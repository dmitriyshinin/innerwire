### Criticism and limitations

- **Koolhaas, J. M., Bartolomucci, A., Buwalda, B., de Boer, S. F., Flugge, G., Korte, S. M., ... & Fuchs, E. (2011).** Stress revisited: A critical evaluation of the stress concept. *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 35*(5), 1291–1301.

  Argues that the allostatic load framework, while useful, overlaps substantially with earlier stress concepts (Selye's general adaptation syndrome) and may not add as much theoretical novelty as claimed. Questions whether "allostasis" is truly a paradigm shift or a repackaging of existing ideas.

- **Dowd, J. B., Simanek, A. M., & Aiello, A. E. (2009).** Socioeconomic status, cortisol, and allostatic load: A review of the literature. *International Journal of Epidemiology, 38*(5), 1297–1309.

  Reviews the relationship between socioeconomic status and allostatic load biomarkers. Notes inconsistencies across studies in which biomarkers are included, how cut-offs are defined, and whether the composite index adds predictive value beyond individual biomarkers.

- **Ganzel, B. L., Morris, P. A., & Wethington, E. (2010).** Allostasis and the human brain: Integrating models of stress from the social and life sciences. *Psychological Review, 117*(1), 134–174.

  Provides a critical integration of the allostasis concept with developmental and social science perspectives. Notes that the biological model underemphasizes the role of social context and cognitive appraisal in mediating stress outcomes.

### Limitations of self-report proxies

Self-report questionnaires that estimate allostatic load from symptoms (including ours) have inherent limitations. True allostatic load is a composite of laboratory biomarkers — cortisol curves, inflammatory markers, metabolic indicators, cardiovascular parameters. Symptom-based proxies correlate with these biomarkers but are influenced by additional factors: mood state, interoceptive sensitivity (Layer 1), personality traits, and context. We include a self-assessment questionnaire because it can raise useful awareness, but it is not equivalent to biomarker measurement. We are explicit about this limitation in the questionnaire itself.
