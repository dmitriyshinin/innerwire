# Questionnaire: Allostatic Load

> **This is NOT a medical test.** It is a self-observation tool that uses symptom proxies and lifestyle factors to help you estimate your current stress burden. It cannot replace laboratory biomarkers or clinical evaluation. If your results concern you, please see a healthcare professional. See the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the end.

## How to use

Answer based on the last **2-3 months** — not your worst week, not your best week, but the general trend. Be honest rather than optimistic. Rate each item from 0 to 3:

- **0** — not at all / rarely
- **1** — sometimes / mildly
- **2** — often / noticeably
- **3** — most of the time / severely

## Part 1: Physical symptoms

*These questions use common physical complaints as proxies for the neuroendocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune markers used in allostatic load research.*

| # | Item | 0-3 |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | I wake up tired, even after what should be enough sleep | ___ |
| 2 | I get sick (colds, infections) more often than I used to, or more than people around me | ___ |
| 3 | When I get sick or injured, recovery takes noticeably longer than it used to | ___ |
| 4 | I experience persistent muscle tension or pain (back, neck, shoulders, jaw) that isn't explained by a specific injury | ___ |
| 5 | My sleep is disrupted — difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early | ___ |
| 6 | I've noticed unexplained changes in weight or appetite (increase or decrease) | ___ |
| 7 | I experience digestive issues (bloating, nausea, IBS-like symptoms) without a clear medical cause | ___ |
| 8 | My energy has a "crash" pattern — I push through, then collapse | ___ |

**Part 1 subtotal: ___ / 24**

## Part 2: Cognitive markers

*Chronic stress affects the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which govern attention, working memory, and learning. These questions probe those functions.*

| # | Item | 0-3 |
|---|------|-----|
| 9 | I experience "brain fog" — difficulty thinking clearly, finding words, or holding thoughts | ___ |
| 10 | My working memory feels worse — I walk into a room and forget why, lose track of conversations | ___ |
| 11 | It's harder to concentrate for sustained periods than it was a year or two ago | ___ |
| 12 | I make more errors on routine tasks (typos, forgetting steps, small mistakes) | ___ |
| 13 | Decision-making feels effortful — even small choices can feel overwhelming | ___ |
| 14 | I have trouble learning or retaining new information | ___ |

**Part 2 subtotal: ___ / 18**


---


## Part 3: Emotional indicators

*Emotional regulation depends on the same neural and hormonal systems that allostatic load degrades. These questions assess emotional flexibility and recovery capacity.*

| # | Item | 0-3 |
|---|------|-----|
| 15 | My emotional reactions are disproportionate — I snap at small things, or feel crushed by minor setbacks | ___ |
| 16 | I feel emotionally "flat" — positive events don't register as strongly as they should | ___ |
| 17 | It takes me a long time to recover emotionally after a stressful event (days rather than hours) | ___ |
| 18 | I feel less empathy or patience for others than I normally would | ___ |
| 19 | I feel detached or disconnected — going through the motions without really being present | ___ |
| 20 | I experience anxiety or a sense of dread that isn't tied to a specific event | ___ |

**Part 3 subtotal: ___ / 18**

## Part 4: Lifestyle load factors

*Allostatic load accumulates from sustained demands across life domains. These questions assess the incoming load — what your body's stress-response systems are dealing with.*

| # | Item | 0-3 |
|---|------|-----|
| 21 | I regularly work more than 45 hours per week, or work during times meant for rest (evenings, weekends) | ___ |
| 22 | I have significant caregiving responsibilities (children, aging parents, ill family members) with inadequate support | ___ |
| 23 | I am dealing with ongoing financial stress or instability | ___ |
| 24 | I feel socially isolated — I lack people I can turn to when things are hard | ___ |
| 25 | My living or working environment is chronically noisy, crowded, or otherwise physically stressful | ___ |
| 26 | I have an unresolved conflict or chronically stressful relationship that I deal with regularly | ___ |
| 27 | I rarely have time for activities that genuinely restore me (not just numbing or distraction) | ___ |
| 28 | I rely on substances (caffeine, alcohol, sleep aids, etc.) to manage my energy or mood on a regular basis | ___ |

**Part 4 subtotal: ___ / 24**

## Scoring

**Total score: ___ / 84**

Add up all four subtotals. Then locate your range:

### 0-15: Low load

Your current stress burden appears manageable and your recovery systems seem to be keeping up. This is a good baseline to maintain. Keep doing what you're doing — and notice what supports this state so you can return to it if things change.

### 16-35: Moderate load

Your body's stress tab is running, but not critically. You likely notice some of the symptoms above — fatigue, occasional brain fog, emotional reactivity — but they're not dominating your life. This is a good time to take preventive action: look at the [practices](practices.md) section, especially sleep and stress audit.

### 36-55: High load

Your stress-response systems are working hard and showing signs of strain. Multiple symptoms are present across domains. This is the range where allostatic load starts having real health consequences if it continues. We strongly recommend:
- Reading the [practices](practices.md) carefully and implementing changes
- Evaluating what chronic stressors can be reduced or eliminated
- Considering professional support (therapy, medical evaluation)

### 56-84: Very high load

Your body's stress-response systems appear significantly strained. You likely recognize many of the symptoms listed above as your daily reality. At this level, self-help practices alone may not be sufficient.

> **We strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional.** A doctor can order the actual biomarker tests (cortisol, CRP, HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol) that measure allostatic load directly. A therapist can help address the psychological contributors. This is not weakness — this is taking the data seriously.

## Subtotal patterns

Beyond the total score, look at the **distribution** across parts:

- **High Part 1, lower others:** Your body may be bearing the brunt — physical symptoms are the primary signal. A medical checkup is especially warranted.
- **High Part 2:** Cognitive load is prominent. Consider whether sleep deprivation, information overload, or work demands are driving this.
- **High Part 3:** Emotional regulation is strained. This may connect strongly to Layer 0 (autonomic profile) and Layer 3 (attachment pattern).
- **High Part 4:** The incoming load is high. Before optimizing coping strategies, consider whether any demands can actually be reduced. Sometimes the most important intervention is structural, not psychological.

## Tracking over time

Because allostatic load is a state that changes, it's valuable to retake this questionnaire periodically — every 2-3 months. Track your total score and subtotal distribution. Changes of 10+ points in either direction are meaningful.

```
Date: ___   Total: ___/84
  Physical: ___/24  Cognitive: ___/18  Emotional: ___/18  Lifestyle: ___/24
Notes: ___
```

> **This questionnaire does NOT diagnose any medical condition.** Many of the symptoms listed above can have medical causes unrelated to stress. Persistent physical symptoms should always be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider.
