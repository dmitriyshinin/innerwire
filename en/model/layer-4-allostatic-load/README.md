# Layer 4: Allostatic Load

> Your body keeps a stress tab. This layer measures how high it's gotten.

## Contents

- [Description](description.md) — what allostatic load is and how it works
- [Questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — estimate your current load level
- [Practices](practices.md) — how to reduce the load and support recovery
- [Sources](sources.md) — scientific basis

## Quick start

1. Read the [description](description.md) — 10 minutes
2. Take the [self-assessment questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — 10 minutes
3. Check the [recommended practices](practices.md) based on your results

## How this layer is different

Layers 0-3 describe relatively stable individual differences — how your system is wired. Layer 4 is different. It measures a **current state** that changes over time: the cumulative physiological cost of chronic stress. Think of it as a meter, not a trait.

This means:
- Your allostatic load **can go up** (chronic stress, poor recovery, sustained overwork)
- Your allostatic load **can go down** (rest, social support, reduced demands, professional help)
- It's worth **re-assessing periodically** — every few months makes sense

## Connection to all other layers

Layer 4 is the **integrator**. Chronic dysregulation in any other layer contributes to allostatic load:

- **Layer 0 (Autonomic Profile):** Spending most of your time in mobilization or freeze means your stress-response systems are chronically active. This is a direct contributor to allostatic load.
- **Layer 1 (Interoceptive Profile):** Poor interoception means you miss early signals of overload — you don't notice you're exhausted until you crash. This delays recovery and allows load to accumulate.
- **Layer 2 (Sensory Profile):** Sensory overload or sensory seeking that isn't managed adds a constant low-level stressor to the system.
- **Layer 3 (Attachment Pattern):** Insecure attachment patterns mean less access to the most powerful load-reducer we have: safe social connection.

And in reverse: high allostatic load degrades functioning across all layers. When the body's stress-response systems are worn out, autonomic flexibility decreases, interoceptive accuracy drops, sensory thresholds shift, and relational capacity narrows.

This is why Layer 4 is at the top of the stack: it's the cumulative output of everything below.
