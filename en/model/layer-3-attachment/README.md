## Connection to other layers

Attachment patterns and autonomic regulation are deeply intertwined. Your earliest relationships with caregivers literally shaped your nervous system's defaults (Layer 0). A child whose caregiver was consistently available developed a nervous system that expects safety in closeness. A child whose caregiver was unpredictable or unavailable developed a system that treats closeness as a potential threat.

This means your attachment pattern is not just "psychology" — it has a physiological substrate. When you feel anxious about a partner not texting back, that is your autonomic nervous system shifting into mobilization. When you shut down emotionally after a conflict, that may be your dorsal vagus activating freeze mode.

Working on attachment and working on autonomic regulation support each other. As you expand your window of tolerance for closeness (Layer 3), you also expand your access to connection mode (Layer 0). And vice versa.
