# Questionnaire: Attachment Pattern

## How to use

This is a self-observation tool, not a clinical test. It helps you notice patterns in how you relate to people you're close to — particularly romantic partners, but also close friends and family.

Answer based on the last 6-12 months. If you're currently in a relationship, answer about that relationship. If not, answer based on your most recent significant relationship or your general pattern with close people.

There are no right or wrong answers. There are only honest ones.

> Important: Your attachment pattern may be different in different relationships. If you notice that your answers would change depending on who you're thinking about — that is itself valuable information, not a flaw in the questionnaire.

## Part 1: Attachment anxiety scale

*"How much do I worry about closeness, loss, and whether I'm enough?"*

Rate each statement from 1 to 7:
**1** = strongly disagree, **4** = neutral, **7** = strongly agree

| # | Statement | 1-7 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | I worry about being abandoned by people I'm close to | ___ |
| 2 | When my partner doesn't respond quickly, I start imagining the worst | ___ |
| 3 | I need more reassurance than most people that I am loved | ___ |
| 4 | I often worry that my partner doesn't care about me as much as I care about them | ___ |
| 5 | After a disagreement, I can't stop thinking about it until things are resolved | ___ |
| 6 | When I notice my partner being distant, I feel a wave of anxiety in my body | ___ |
| 7 | I sometimes test people to see if they really care (e.g., pulling away to see if they'll come closer) | ___ |
| 8 | I find myself replaying interactions, looking for signs that something is wrong | ___ |
| 9 | The thought of losing my closest person feels unbearable — more than just sad | ___ |
| 10 | I am very sensitive to shifts in my partner's mood or tone of voice | ___ |
| 11 | When a relationship is going well, I sometimes worry it's "too good to last" | ___ |

**Anxiety total: ___ / 84**

## Part 2: Attachment avoidance scale

*"How comfortable am I with closeness, vulnerability, and depending on others?"*

Rate each statement from 1 to 7:
**1** = strongly disagree, **4** = neutral, **7** = strongly agree

| # | Statement | 1-7 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | I prefer to handle my problems on my own rather than turning to others | ___ |
| 2 | I feel uncomfortable when someone wants to be very close to me emotionally | ___ |
| 3 | When things get emotional, my instinct is to create distance | ___ |
| 4 | I don't like feeling dependent on anyone | ___ |
| 5 | I find it hard to fully trust my partner, even when there's no reason to doubt them | ___ |
| 6 | I have been told that I am "hard to read" or "emotionally unavailable" | ___ |
| 7 | When my partner is upset, I sometimes feel the urge to leave the room (physically or mentally) | ___ |
| 8 | I feel more relaxed when I have significant time alone | ___ |
| 9 | I tend to keep conversations at a practical level rather than going into feelings | ___ |
| 10 | The idea of someone needing me too much makes me uncomfortable | ___ |
| 11 | I sometimes feel that relationships take more than they give | ___ |
| 12 | When someone gets very vulnerable with me, I feel awkward or want to change the subject | ___ |

**Avoidance total: ___ / 84**

## Part 3: Context check

*"Is my pattern consistent or does it shift?"*

Think about your responses in Part 1 and Part 2. Now consider these different relationships:

| Relationship | Would my anxiety score be... | Would my avoidance score be... |
|---|---|---|
| Romantic partner (current or most recent) | higher / same / lower | higher / same / lower |
| Closest friend | higher / same / lower | higher / same / lower |
| Parent/caregiver (the one you feel most complicated about) | higher / same / lower | higher / same / lower |
| A colleague or more distant friend | higher / same / lower | higher / same / lower |

If your scores shift significantly across relationships, you're experiencing context-dependent attachment — which is the norm, not the exception.

## Part 4: Behavioral observations

*"What do I actually do?"*

Check the behaviors you recognize in yourself. These are not good or bad — they are data.

### When the attachment system is activated (conflict, distance, uncertainty):

**Proximity-seeking behaviors (linked to anxiety):**
- [ ] I call or text repeatedly to get a response
- [ ] I bring up the issue again and again until it feels resolved
- [ ] I become more affectionate or attentive than usual, hoping for reciprocation
- [ ] I express frustration or anger to provoke engagement ("at least fighting means they care")
- [ ] I monitor my partner's social media, location, or communications
- [ ] I cry or express distress openly to signal that I need comfort

**Distancing behaviors (linked to avoidance):**
- [ ] I withdraw and become quiet or "busy"
- [ ] I minimize the issue ("It's not a big deal, let's move on")
- [ ] I focus on practical tasks instead of discussing feelings
- [ ] I mentally disengage — I'm physically present but checked out
- [ ] I feel an urge to leave or be alone when emotions run high
- [ ] I find myself thinking "I'd be fine on my own"

**Push-pull behaviors (linked to fearful pattern):**
- [ ] I reach out, then regret it and pull back
- [ ] I want someone to comfort me but feel worse when they try
- [ ] I feel drawn to someone and simultaneously want to run away
- [ ] I oscillate between "I need you" and "I need space" in the same conversation

## Part 5: Body responses

*"Where do I feel attachment activation in my body?"*

When you think about a relationship conflict or potential loss, notice:

- [ ] Tightness or ache in the chest
- [ ] Pit in the stomach, nausea
- [ ] Throat constriction, feeling of a lump
- [ ] Agitation, restlessness, inability to sit still
- [ ] Numbness, feeling "flat" or disconnected
- [ ] Heat in the face, rapid heartbeat
- [ ] Heaviness, fatigue, wanting to curl up
- [ ] Shallow breathing or holding breath

> These are your nervous system's attachment responses — the same autonomic activations described in Layer 0. Anxiety-related behaviors often involve mobilization (sympathetic activation), while avoidance-related behaviors often involve a mix of suppression and, in the fearful zone, freeze.

## Interpretation

### Plotting your position

Take your two scores:

- **Anxiety total:** ___ / 84
- **Avoidance total:** ___ / 84

Divide each by 12 to get an average (1-7 scale):

- **Anxiety average:** ___
- **Avoidance average:** ___

Now imagine a 2D space:
- X-axis: Avoidance (left = low, right = high)
- Y-axis: Anxiety (bottom = low, top = high)

```
        high anxiety
             |
 Preoccupied |  Fearful
    zone     |   zone
             |
-------------+-------------
             |
   Secure    |  Dismissing
    zone     |   zone
             |
        low anxiety

  low avoidance    high avoidance
```

Plot your point. Where does it fall?

### What does your position mean?

**Low anxiety + low avoidance (secure zone):**
Your attachment system generally works smoothly. You can seek support and give it. Conflict is uncomfortable but manageable.

**High anxiety + low avoidance (preoccupied zone):**
Your system is hypervigilant to relational threats. You want closeness and are comfortable with it — but the fear of losing it creates a lot of distress.

**Low anxiety + high avoidance (dismissing zone):**
Your system downplays attachment needs. You manage on your own, often at the cost of emotional depth in relationships.

**High anxiety + high avoidance (fearful zone):**
Your system is caught between wanting and fearing closeness. This is the most distressing position — you may feel stuck between reaching out and pulling away.

**In between:**
Most people don't sit perfectly in one zone. You might be moderate on both axes (somewhat secure, slightly anxious), or high on one and moderate on the other. The specific numbers matter less than the overall direction.

Now that you have your approximate position, go to [practices](practices.md) to learn what you can do with this awareness.

## About this questionnaire's accuracy

This is a self-observation tool, not the ECR-R. It was inspired by the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (Brennan, Clark & Shaver, 1998; revised by Fraley, Waller & Brennan, 2000) but has not been validated as a standalone instrument.

For a validated measure of attachment dimensions, you can take the ECR-R online (freely available at R. Chris Fraley's research website).

This questionnaire's purpose is not to give you a score with decimal precision. It is to help you notice patterns that usually operate below awareness. If it made you think about your relationship behaviors in a new way, it did its job.
