# Questionnaire: Interoceptive Profile

## How to use

This is a self-observation tool, not a clinical test. There are no right answers. It helps you notice how you relate to signals from inside your body.

Answer based on the last 2-3 months. Don't pick the "ideal" answer — pick the honest one. If a question confuses you — that itself is useful information.

This questionnaire maps three dimensions: accuracy (how well you detect), sensibility (how much attention you pay), and awareness (how well your self-assessment matches reality).

## Part 1: Interoceptive sensibility

*"How much do I pay attention to my body's signals?"*

Rate each statement from 1 (not me at all) to 5 (definitely me):

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | When I'm stressed, I can feel it in my body before I name the emotion | ___ |
| 2 | I notice when my breathing pattern changes (faster, shallower, holding) | ___ |
| 3 | I can usually tell the difference between "hungry" and "just wanting to eat" | ___ |
| 4 | When making an important decision, I check in with how my body feels about it | ___ |
| 5 | I notice when my muscles are tense (jaw, shoulders, stomach) without someone pointing it out | ___ |
| 6 | I can feel my heart beating without touching my pulse, at least sometimes | ___ |
| 7 | I notice subtle changes in my energy level throughout the day | ___ |
| 8 | When someone says something hurtful, I notice the body sensation before the thought | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 40**

- **32-40:** High sensibility — you report strong body-signal attention
- **20-31:** Moderate sensibility — some signals come through, others don't
- **8-19:** Low sensibility — body signals rarely register consciously

## Part 2: Signal detection check

*"Can I actually detect what I think I detect?"*

These are brief self-experiments. Do them now, one at a time.

### Experiment A: Heartbeat detection

Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Without touching your pulse anywhere, try to feel your heartbeat from the inside. Count beats for 30 seconds. Write down your count.

Now take your pulse (wrist or neck) and count for 30 seconds again.

**My count without touching: ___**
**My actual pulse count: ___**

How close were you?
- [ ] Within 5 beats — quite accurate
- [ ] Off by 5-15 beats — moderate accuracy
- [ ] Off by more than 15 beats or couldn't feel it at all — low accuracy for heartbeat

### Experiment B: Breathing awareness

For the next 60 seconds, breathe normally and count your natural breaths (one inhale + one exhale = one breath). Don't try to control your breathing.

**My breath count: ___**

Now, did you notice:
- [ ] My breathing was natural the whole time — I observed without changing it
- [ ] I started natural, but then noticed I was controlling it
- [ ] I was controlling my breathing from the start — I couldn't just observe

### Experiment C: Hunger-or-not

Think about your stomach right now. Without looking at a clock or thinking about when you last ate:

- [ ] I can feel a clear physical signal of hunger or fullness right now
- [ ] I have a vague sense but can't be very specific
- [ ] I honestly have no idea what my stomach feels like right now

## Part 3: Body signal inventory

*"Which signals do I pick up, and which do I miss?"*

For each body signal, check whether you typically notice it in daily life (not during deliberate attention, but spontaneously):

### Signals I usually notice
- [ ] Heart rate changes (faster during stress, slower at rest)
- [ ] Breathing changes (shallow, deep, held)
- [ ] Hunger (stomach sensations, not clock-based)
- [ ] Thirst
- [ ] Fatigue / low energy (body-based, not just "wanting to stop")
- [ ] Muscle tension (shoulders, jaw, back)
- [ ] Temperature changes (feeling hot, cold, or flushed)
- [ ] Gut sensations (butterflies, tightness, nausea)
- [ ] Need to use the bathroom (before it becomes urgent)
- [ ] Pain or discomfort (headache, stiffness, ache)

### Signals I often miss
- [ ] Heart rate changes
- [ ] Breathing changes
- [ ] Hunger (I forget to eat / don't notice until I'm starving)
- [ ] Thirst (I only drink when very thirsty or by habit)
- [ ] Fatigue (I push through until I crash)
- [ ] Muscle tension (others notice before I do)
- [ ] Temperature changes
- [ ] Gut sensations
- [ ] Need to use the bathroom (I wait too long)
- [ ] Pain (I ignore it until it's severe)

**Signals I notice: ___ / 10**
**Signals I miss: ___ / 10**

## Part 4: Relationship with body signals

*"How do I respond when I do notice something?"*

Rate each statement from 1 (not me at all) to 5 (definitely me):

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | When I notice an unfamiliar body sensation, my first reaction is curiosity, not alarm | ___ |
| 2 | I trust the information my body gives me | ___ |
| 3 | I can notice a body sensation without immediately trying to make it go away | ___ |
| 4 | When I feel discomfort in my body, I can stay with it long enough to understand what it's telling me | ___ |
| 5 | I don't worry excessively about body sensations | ___ |
| 6 | Body signals help me make better decisions (not worse ones) | ___ |
| 7 | I can tell the difference between a body sensation that needs medical attention and one that's just normal variation | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 35**

- **28-35:** Healthy relationship — you trust and use body signals without overreacting
- **18-27:** Mixed relationship — some signals feel useful, others feel confusing or threatening
- **7-17:** Difficult relationship — body signals tend to cause anxiety or get ignored

## Part 5: Self-assessment accuracy

*"Do I know myself as well as I think?"*

Look back at your Part 1 total (sensibility self-report) and Part 2 results (signal detection).

### Compare:

**If Part 1 is high (32-40) AND Part 2 showed good accuracy:**
Your sensibility matches your accuracy. You pay attention, and the attention is well-founded. This suggests good interoceptive awareness.

**If Part 1 is high (32-40) BUT Part 2 showed low accuracy:**
You report high body attention, but when tested, detection was poor. This gap is common and can contribute to anxiety about body sensations. Your brain may be "filling in" signals that aren't actually there, or misinterpreting noise as signal.

**If Part 1 is low (8-19) AND Part 2 showed low accuracy:**
Low attention, low detection. Consistent — but it means you may be missing important body information. Not a crisis, but worth developing.

**If Part 1 is low (8-19) BUT Part 2 showed good accuracy:**
You don't think you pay attention to your body, but when you actually try, you're better than you expected. This is an underutilized resource.

## Interpretation

### Mapping your pattern

Gather your results:

1. **Part 1 (sensibility):** How much attention do you report paying? High / Moderate / Low
2. **Part 2 (detection):** How well did you actually detect in the experiments? High / Moderate / Low
3. **Part 3 (signal inventory):** Which specific signals do you catch and which do you miss?
4. **Part 4 (relationship):** How do you relate to the signals you receive? Trust / Mixed / Anxiety-avoidance
5. **Part 5 (self-assessment):** Does your self-report match your actual performance?

Try describing your interoceptive pattern in one or two sentences. For example:

- *"I pay a lot of attention to my body but my detection is actually moderate — I may be over-interpreting signals. My relationship with body signals is anxious."*
- *"I don't pay much attention and my detection is low. I miss hunger, fatigue, and tension. I live in my head."*
- *"My detection varies — good for some signals, poor for others. I notice tension but miss breathing changes."*
- *"I detect well and my self-assessment is accurate. I trust my body signals and they generally help me."*

## About this questionnaire's accuracy

This is a self-observation tool, not a validated clinical instrument. The heartbeat detection experiment in Part 2 is inspired by the Schandry (1981) task, but the conditions here are not controlled — results are approximate at best.

For precise interoceptive assessment, laboratory methods exist: the heartbeat detection task with ECG, the heartbeat discrimination task (Whitehead et al., 1977), the MAIA-2 validated questionnaire (Mehling et al., 2018), and gastric-brain coupling measures. See [sources](sources.md) for details.

The purpose of this questionnaire is to help you start noticing how you relate to body signals — not to provide a clinical score.
