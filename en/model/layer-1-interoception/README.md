## Connection to other layers

Layer 0 (Autonomic Profile) describes *which mode* your nervous system is in. Layer 1 asks: *can you actually feel it?*

Interoception is the bridge between your body's state and your conscious experience. Without it, autonomic modes remain invisible — you might be deep in mobilization and not realize it until you snap at someone. With good interoception, you catch the signal earlier and have more room to respond.

Layer 1 also connects forward: your interoceptive profile shapes how you experience emotions (Layer 2+), because according to current research, emotions are partly constructed from interoceptive signals.
