# Practices: Interoceptive Profile

## Principle

The goal is not to maximize interoceptive sensitivity — more is not always better. The goal is **calibration**: developing an accurate, trustworthy channel between body and mind. You want to detect real signals, not amplify noise; to pay appropriate attention, not obsessive attention; and to know when your body's input is useful and when it isn't.

## Practice for everyone: The body scan check-in

**For whom:** any interoceptive pattern. This is the foundational practice.

**What to do:**
Three times a day — morning, midday, evening — pause for 60 seconds. Scan through your body systematically: feet, legs, belly, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face. For each area, notice: is there any sensation? Tension, warmth, heaviness, tingling, nothing? Don't try to change anything. Just notice and move on.

End by asking yourself: *"On a scale of pleasant-to-unpleasant, how does my body feel right now?"*

**Why it works:**
Repeated, brief interoceptive check-ins train the neural pathways between body and the insular cortex — the brain region responsible for conscious body awareness (Craig, 2009). This is not conceptual — it is a form of perceptual training. Just as you can train your ear to hear intervals in music, you can train your interoceptive sense. The key is frequency and regularity, not duration. Mehling et al. (2018) found that body awareness practices improve MAIA scores even when practiced briefly but consistently.

**Duration:** 60 seconds, 3 times a day. Minimum 2 weeks to begin noticing differences. Can continue indefinitely.

## If your pattern is "high sensor" (high attention, lower accuracy)

Your interoceptive channel is on, but the signal-to-noise ratio is poor. You notice a lot, but you may misinterpret what you notice. The task is not to notice *more* — it's to notice *more accurately* and with less reactivity.

### Practice: Neutral observation

**What to do:**
When you notice a body sensation that triggers a reaction (worry, urgency, need to "fix" it), pause. Instead of labeling it ("this is anxiety," "something is wrong"), describe it in pure physical terms: *"There is a tightness in my chest. It's about the size of a fist. It's warm. It pulses slightly."*

Stay with the physical description for 30 seconds. Then notice: did the sensation change while you were observing it? Did your reaction to it change?

**Why it works:**
Critchley & Garfinkel (2017) note that the emotional reaction to interoceptive signals can amplify and distort them. By separating the raw sensation from the emotional interpretation, you train your brain to process the signal before reacting to it. This reduces the "noise" in the channel without reducing the signal. Over time, this improves actual accuracy — because you're learning what the raw signal feels like without the anxiety overlay.

**Duration:** Each instance takes 30-60 seconds. Practice whenever you catch yourself reacting to a body sensation. Over 3-4 weeks, the response begins to shift.

### Practice: Prediction and check

**What to do:**
Before checking your heart rate (using a pulse or a fitness tracker), predict it. Write down your prediction. Then check the actual number. Do the same with breathing rate: predict your breaths per minute, then count.

Keep a simple log:
```
Predicted heart rate: ___  Actual: ___
Predicted breathing rate: ___  Actual: ___
```

**Why it works:**
Barrett & Simmons (2015) describe interoception as fundamentally a prediction system — the brain predicts what it should feel, then compares the prediction to actual signals. In "high sensor" patterns, predictions run unchecked. This practice forces your predictions into the open where they can be corrected by reality. Over weeks, the gap between predicted and actual narrows — this is calibration.

**Duration:** Once or twice daily for 2-4 weeks.

## If your pattern is "low sensor" (low attention, low accuracy)

Your interoceptive channel is dim. You don't notice much from your body, and what you do notice tends to arrive late — as a full-blown headache rather than an early twinge, as sudden exhaustion rather than gradual fatigue. The task is to gently turn up the volume.

### Practice: Single-signal focus

**What to do:**
Choose one body signal for a whole week. Just one. For example: breathing. Several times a day, notice your breathing for 30 seconds. Don't change it. Just notice: is it fast or slow? Deep or shallow? Through nose or mouth? Smooth or choppy?

Next week, pick a different signal: heartbeat, or stomach, or muscle tension.

**Why it works:**
Trying to notice "everything in the body" at once overwhelms a system that isn't trained for it. Focusing on a single channel reduces the cognitive load and allows the relevant neural pathways to strengthen. Khalsa et al. (2018) noted that interoceptive training is most effective when it starts narrow and expands gradually — similar to how physical rehabilitation starts with isolated muscle groups before progressing to compound movements.

**Duration:** One signal per week. 30-second check-ins, 4-6 times per day. After 4-6 weeks of rotating signals, the overall interoceptive sensitivity typically increases.

### Practice: Movement as amplifier

**What to do:**
Engage in moderate physical activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing) for 10-15 minutes. Immediately after stopping, sit or stand still and scan your body for 2 minutes. Notice: heart rate, breathing, warmth, tingling, muscle fatigue, energy.

**Why it works:**
Exercise amplifies interoceptive signals — your heart is beating harder, your breathing is deeper, your muscles are activated. This creates a "high signal" environment where detection is easier. Practicing body scanning in this amplified state builds the perceptual skill, which then transfers to quieter moments. Paulus & Stein (2010) documented that physical activity interventions improve interoceptive accuracy in populations with low baseline sensitivity.

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes of movement + 2 minutes of scanning. 3-4 times per week.

## If your pattern is "noisy channel" (inconsistent across signals)

Your accuracy varies — good for some signals, poor for others. The interoceptive picture is spotty. The task is to identify your strengths and systematically fill in the gaps.

### Practice: Signal mapping

**What to do:**
Using your questionnaire results (Part 3: body signal inventory), identify your top 3 strongest signals and your top 3 weakest. For one week, practice the "single-signal focus" (above) on one of your weak signals — but anchor each session by first spending 15 seconds noticing one of your strong signals.

**Why it works:**
Starting from a signal you detect well primes the interoceptive system — it's like warming up before exercise. Then shifting attention to a weaker signal leverages that primed state. The "strong signal first" approach also builds confidence: you're reminded that your body *does* talk to you, just not evenly across all channels.

**Duration:** 1 minute per session (15 seconds strong signal + 45 seconds weak signal). 4-6 times per day for 2 weeks per weak signal.

### Practice: Cross-referencing signals

**What to do:**
When you notice a strong signal (e.g., muscle tension), immediately ask: *"What else is happening in my body right now?"* Check two or three other systems: breathing, heart rate, stomach, temperature. Don't analyze — just notice whether there are companion signals.

**Why it works:**
Body signals rarely arrive alone. Stress shows up as a cluster: tension + shallow breathing + faster heart rate + gut tightness. By training yourself to notice the cluster rather than the single signal, you build a richer interoceptive picture. This also helps with accuracy — if multiple signals converge, the interpretation is more likely to be correct.

**Duration:** Each check takes 15-30 seconds. Practice whenever you notice a strong signal naturally. No minimum duration — this practice integrates into daily life.

## If your pattern is "calibrated" (good accuracy + good awareness)

Your interoceptive system works well. The task is maintenance and refinement — and being honest about edge cases where calibration breaks down.

### Practice: Edge-case awareness

**What to do:**
Identify situations where your body sense becomes less reliable: extreme fatigue, alcohol, strong emotions, illness, sleep deprivation. When you're in one of these states, deliberately note: *"My interoception may be less accurate right now."* Don't try to force accuracy — just flag the uncertainty.

**Why it works:**
Even well-calibrated interoceptors have failure modes. Acknowledging them prevents over-reliance. Garfinkel et al. (2015) showed that interoceptive awareness includes knowing when the signal is unreliable — this meta-awareness is the most sophisticated aspect of interoception and worth cultivating.

**Duration:** Ongoing awareness practice. No specific time commitment.

## General recommendations

1. **Start with the foundational practice.** The body scan check-in works for everyone. Do it for at least two weeks before adding pattern-specific practices.
2. **Don't force detection.** If you can't feel your heartbeat, that's data, not failure. Trying too hard creates false signals.
3. **Consistency beats intensity.** Brief daily check-ins are more effective than long weekly sessions. The neural pathways respond to frequency.
4. **Notice, don't judge.** The point is to observe what's there, not to have the "right" experience. "I didn't feel anything" is a perfectly valid observation.
5. **Watch for amplification.** If body-focused practices increase your anxiety about body sensations, reduce intensity or switch to the "neutral observation" practice. Increased attention should feel curious, not threatening.
6. **This is not a substitute for medical care.** If you notice persistent concerning body symptoms, see a doctor. Improved interoception can help you communicate symptoms more clearly — but it doesn't replace professional assessment.
