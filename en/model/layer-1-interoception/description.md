# Listening to the body: three dimensions of interoception

## The core idea in one sentence

Your brain constantly receives signals from inside your body — heartbeat, breath, gut, temperature, muscle tension — and how well you detect, attend to, and understand these signals shapes your emotions, decisions, and sense of self.

## What is interoception

You probably know the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste. There's another sense that rarely gets mentioned — the sense of your own body's internal state. This is interoception.

Right now, without touching your wrist, can you feel your heart beating? Can you tell whether your breathing is shallow or deep? Do you notice when your stomach is empty versus just bored? Can you sense the difference between anxiety and excitement in your chest before your mind labels it?

These are interoceptive signals. Your brain processes a continuous stream of them — from the heart, lungs, gut, blood vessels, muscles, skin. Most of this processing happens below conscious awareness. But some of it reaches you. How much, and how accurately — that varies enormously from person to person.

This matters because interoception is not just a curiosity. Neuroscientist A.D. (Bud) Craig has argued that interoception is the foundation of subjective feeling itself — the basis of what it feels like to be you, right now. Lisa Feldman Barrett's research goes further: emotions, in her model, are not hardwired circuits but constructions that the brain builds partly from interoceptive data. Your brain takes the raw signals from the body — heart rate, gut sensations, muscle tension — and interprets them in context. The same racing heart might become "excitement" at a concert or "panic" in a dark alley.

If your interoceptive channel is clear, you get better raw data. If it's noisy or shut down, your brain has to guess more — and guesses can be wrong.

## Three axes

Interoception is not a single thing you either "have" or "don't have." Research by Hugo Critchley, Sarah Garfinkel, and colleagues has identified three distinct dimensions. You can be high on one and low on another — and that combination matters.

### Axis 1: Interoceptive accuracy

**What it is:** How precisely you actually detect signals from inside your body, measured by objective tests.

The classic example is the heartbeat detection task: sit quietly and count your heartbeats without touching your pulse. Then compare your count to what a heart monitor recorded. Some people are remarkably accurate. Others are way off.

**How it shows up in daily life:**
- You notice your heart rate changing before you consciously feel "anxious"
- You can tell the difference between "hungry" and "nauseous" early, before it becomes obvious
- You catch subtle shifts in energy or fatigue
- You notice you're holding your breath during a difficult conversation

**Important:** high accuracy is not automatically "better." People with high interoceptive accuracy and anxiety disorders can become hypervigilant about body sensations, interpreting every flutter as a sign of danger.

### Axis 2: Interoceptive sensibility

**What it is:** How much attention you *believe* you pay to body signals. This is self-reported — it's your subjective sense of how tuned in you are.

**How it shows up in daily life:**
- You describe yourself as "very aware of my body"
- You notice when conversations about body sensations make you curious or anxious
- You tend to check in with how your body feels when making decisions
- You might say things like "my gut says no" and mean it literally

**The catch:** sensibility and accuracy don't always match. You might think you're very body-aware, but when tested objectively, your detection is actually poor. Or you might dismiss body signals as unimportant but actually be quite accurate when tested.

### Axis 3: Interoceptive awareness

**What it is:** The correspondence between your accuracy and your sensibility. Do your beliefs about your body-sensing ability match your actual ability? This is metacognitive — it's about knowing what you know (and what you don't).

**How it shows up in daily life:**
- If you're accurate and know it — you can trust your body's signals as useful data
- If you're inaccurate but think you're accurate — you may make decisions based on "gut feelings" that are actually noise
- If you're accurate but don't know it — you have useful data but ignore it

**Why this matters most:** Garfinkel et al. (2015) showed that interoceptive awareness — this metacognitive dimension — is the best predictor of how well interoception actually helps you in daily life. It's not enough to have the signal. You need to know how reliable the signal is.

## Important: this is not a type

There is no "interoceptive type." These are three independent continuums. Your position on each one:

- Changes over time
- Differs by signal type (you might be accurate for heartbeat but not for breathing)
- Is influenced by your current state (stress reduces accuracy; mindfulness practice increases it)
- Can be trained

The "patterns" below are common zones on these continuums — not boxes. Most people are somewhere in between. They exist to help you recognize tendencies, not to assign a label.

## Common patterns

### "Calibrated"

High accuracy + high sensibility + good awareness. You detect body signals well, you pay attention to them, and your self-assessment matches reality.

**What it looks like:** You catch early signs of fatigue, hunger, emotional shifts. You tend to trust your body's input and it tends to be right. You might describe yourself as having good "gut instincts." When you say "something feels off," there usually is something off.

**Potential blind spot:** Can become over-reliant on body signals in situations that require analytical thinking. Not every decision should be delegated to the gut.

### "High sensor"

High sensibility + low-to-moderate accuracy. You pay a lot of attention to body signals, but your detection isn't as precise as you believe.

**What it looks like:** You're very focused on body sensations. You might frequently interpret ambiguous signals as alarming. A normal post-meal sensation becomes "something is wrong with my stomach." A skipped heartbeat (which happens in every healthy heart) becomes "is this a heart attack?" You might visit doctors frequently, or spend time researching symptoms.

**Important nuance:** this pattern is not "hypochondria" — it's a signal-processing issue. The attention is real and intense. The accuracy just hasn't caught up.

**Connection to Layer 0:** This pattern often correlates with a mobilization-dominant autonomic profile. An activated nervous system amplifies body sensations and biases their interpretation toward threat.

### "Low sensor"

Low sensibility + low accuracy. You don't pay much attention to body signals, and you don't detect them well.

**What it looks like:** You "live in your head." You might skip meals without noticing you're hungry, push through fatigue until you collapse, not realize you're angry until you've already said something hurtful. Emotions seem to arrive without a body component — you feel "suddenly upset" without the buildup that others notice.

**Connection to Layer 0:** This pattern often correlates with a freeze-dominant or a chronically mobilized autonomic profile. Both can dampen interoceptive sensitivity — freeze through general shutdown, chronic mobilization through overriding body signals in favor of action.

### "Noisy channel"

Variable accuracy across different signals. You detect some body signals well and others poorly. The overall picture is inconsistent.

**What it looks like:** You might be great at noticing hunger but terrible at noticing fatigue. You can feel your heart racing in anxiety but can't tell when your breathing has become shallow. Some days your body "talks to you" clearly; other days it goes silent.

**Why this happens:** Different interoceptive signals use different pathways and involve different brain regions. It is entirely normal for accuracy to vary. Most people are closer to this pattern than to any of the others.

## What shapes your interoceptive pattern

Your interoceptive profile is not fixed. It's shaped by:

- **Early experience** — children who grow up in environments where body signals were acknowledged ("you look tired," "you seem upset") develop better interoceptive skills. Children whose signals were ignored or overridden ("you're not hungry, you just ate") may learn to distrust their body
- **Chronic stress and trauma** — prolonged stress can either amplify interoceptive signals (hypervigilance) or dampen them (dissociation). Both shift the pattern
- **Physical health and movement** — regular physical activity is associated with better interoceptive accuracy. Sedentary lifestyles and chronic pain can alter the signal
- **Contemplative practices** — meditation, yoga, tai chi, and other body-awareness practices have been shown to improve interoceptive accuracy over time
- **Attention habits** — if you've spent decades ignoring your body, the neural pathways for interoception are weaker. If you've spent years anxiously monitoring it, they may be overactive
- **Age** — interoceptive accuracy tends to decline with age, but interoceptive awareness (the metacognitive piece) can improve with experience

### Body-to-brain pathways

The interoceptive system relies on a dedicated neural highway. Signals from internal organs travel primarily via two routes:

**1. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X):** Carries about 80% of interoceptive information from the gut, heart, lungs, and other viscera to the brainstem (specifically the nucleus tractus solitarius, NTS). This is the same nerve involved in Layer 0's autonomic regulation — the body-to-brain direction of that same channel.

**2. The lamina I spinothalamic pathway:** Carries signals about temperature, pain, itch, muscular effort, and other "small fiber" sensations through the spinal cord to the thalamus.

Both pathways converge on the **posterior insula**, then get processed forward to the **anterior insula** — the region Craig (2009) identified as the key hub for conscious interoceptive awareness. The anterior insula integrates body signals with context, memory, and prediction to create a moment-by-moment representation of "how you feel right now."

### Constructed emotion and interoception

Lisa Feldman Barrett's theory of constructed emotion (2017) proposes that the brain doesn't have dedicated "emotion circuits" that fire when you feel fear, anger, or joy. Instead, the brain continuously generates predictions about what the body needs, compares them to incoming interoceptive signals, and constructs emotional experiences from the mismatch (or match).

In this model, interoception provides the raw material — what Barrett calls "affect" — a basic sense of feeling pleasant/unpleasant and activated/deactivated. The brain then categorizes this affect using past experience and current context to produce a discrete emotion.

This means your interoceptive profile directly influences your emotional life:
- If you detect body signals accurately, you have richer raw material for emotional construction
- If you don't detect signals well, your brain relies more heavily on prediction and context, which may produce less nuanced emotional experiences
- If you misinterpret signals, the emotions constructed from them may not match the situation

### Measuring interoception: the three-dimension model

Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki, & Critchley (2015) formalized the three-dimension model used in this layer:

- **Interoceptive accuracy** is measured by tasks like heartbeat detection (Schandry, 1981) or heartbeat discrimination (Whitehead et al., 1977). These are behavioral, objective measures.
- **Interoceptive sensibility** is measured by self-report questionnaires, most notably the MAIA-2 (Mehling et al., 2018), which assesses eight subscales of body awareness.
- **Interoceptive awareness** is computed as the relationship between accuracy and sensibility — essentially, how well calibrated your self-knowledge is.

### The MAIA-2 questionnaire

The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness version 2 (MAIA-2) measures eight dimensions:

1. **Noticing** — awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral body sensations
2. **Not-Distracting** — tendency NOT to ignore or distract oneself from pain/discomfort
3. **Not-Worrying** — tendency NOT to react with emotional distress to pain/discomfort
4. **Attention Regulation** — ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations
5. **Emotional Awareness** — awareness of the connection between body sensations and emotional states
6. **Self-Regulation** — ability to regulate psychological distress by attending to body sensations
7. **Body Listening** — active listening to the body for insight
8. **Trusting** — experiencing one's body as safe and trustworthy

This multidimensional approach reveals that "body awareness" is not monolithic. You can score high on Noticing but low on Trusting — meaning you feel everything but don't trust what you feel.

### Criticism and limitations

The interoception field has significant methodological challenges:

**Heartbeat detection tasks are imperfect.** The Schandry (1981) counting task may partly measure time estimation ability rather than true cardiac perception. The Whitehead discrimination task has its own confounds. There is ongoing debate about what these tasks actually measure (Ring & Brener, 2018).

**Self-report measures have inherent limitations.** People who score high on interoceptive sensibility questionnaires may simply be more psychologically minded or more anxious — not necessarily more accurate perceivers.

**The three-dimension model is a framework, not a settled fact.** While it has been useful for organizing research, some researchers argue the dimensions are not as cleanly separable as the model suggests. Interoceptive "accuracy" for heartbeat may not generalize to accuracy for other signals.

**Individual differences are large and poorly understood.** Why some people are good interoceptors and others are not remains unclear. Genetic, developmental, and experiential factors all likely contribute, but the relative weights are unknown.

**Clinical implications are promising but preliminary.** While interoceptive dysfunction has been linked to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, autism, and other conditions (Khalsa et al., 2018), it remains unclear whether improving interoception directly improves these conditions or whether the association is correlational.

In InnerWire, we use the three-dimension model as the best available framework, while acknowledging that the science is still maturing. The model will be updated as research evolves.
