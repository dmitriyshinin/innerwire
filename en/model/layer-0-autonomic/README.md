# Layer 0: Autonomic Profile

> Three modes of your nervous system — and why this matters more than any "personality type"

## Contents

- [Description](description.md) — what the three modes are and how they work
- [Questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — identify your pattern
- [Practices](practices.md) — what to do with the results
- [Sources](sources.md) — scientific basis

## Quick start

1. Read the [description](description.md) — 10 minutes
2. Take the [self-observation questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — 5 minutes
3. Check the [recommended practices](practices.md) for your pattern

## Connection to other layers

The autonomic profile is the foundation. All other InnerWire layers refine and enrich the picture, but this layer works on its own. If you know your autonomic pattern, you already know something important about yourself.
