# Practices: Autonomic Profile

## Principle

The goal isn't to "fix" yourself, but to expand access to connection mode and increase flexibility of switching between modes. You're not "broken" if you live in mobilization or freeze — your nervous system adapted to the experience you had. But adaptation can be updated.

## Practice for everyone: Mode observation

**For whom:** any pattern. This is the foundational practice everyone should start with.

**What to do:**
Three times a day — morning, afternoon, evening — pause whatever you're doing for 30 seconds. Ask yourself one question: *"Which mode am I in right now — connection, mobilization, freeze?"*

No need to change anything. No need to "fix" yourself. Just notice and, if you want, write down one word.

**Why it works:**
The ability to notice your state itself activates the ventral vagus — the part of the nervous system responsible for connection mode. Observing the nervous system slightly shifts you toward connection. This isn't a metaphor — it's a neurophysiological process.

**Duration:** minimum 1 week, but the practice can continue indefinitely.

## If your pattern is predominantly mobilization

Your nervous system habitually operates in "there's a threat, must act" mode. The task is to give it a signal of safety.

### Practice: Extended exhale

**What to do:**
Breathe normally, but lengthen your exhale. If your inhale is 3 counts, exhale for 5-6. No strain, no breath-holding. Just exhale a bit longer. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Can be done anywhere — nobody will notice.

**Why it works:**
Inhaling activates the sympathetic system (mobilization), exhaling activates the parasympathetic (braking). By lengthening the exhale, you literally shift the balance toward braking. This is one of the best-documented ways to voluntarily influence the autonomic nervous system.

### Practice: Orienting response

**What to do:**
Slowly turn your head and look around. Not quickly — slowly. As if you're in an unfamiliar but safe place, curiously exploring it. Hold your gaze on each object for 3-5 seconds. Notice color, shape, texture. Do this for 1-2 minutes.

**Why it works:**
In mobilization mode, attention narrows — you focus on the threat and stop noticing everything else. Slowly scanning the environment is behavior characteristic of a state of safety. Body and nervous system are bidirectionally linked: not only does state affect behavior, but behavior affects state.

### Practice: Discharge through movement

**What to do:**
If tension is strong — let your body physically realize the mobilization. Any intense movement for 5-10 minutes: brisk walking, running, push-ups, dancing, shaking. Afterwards — stop and stand or sit quietly for 2-3 minutes, observing your sensations.

**Why it works:**
Mobilization prepares the body for physical action. If no action occurs, the energy "gets stuck" as tension. Giving it a physical outlet lets the nervous system complete the stress response cycle.

## If your pattern is predominantly freeze

Your nervous system habitually "disconnects" you from the world. The task is to gently "thaw," without triggering a jump into mobilization.

> ⚠️ Important: sudden stimulation during freeze can cause a drop into even deeper freeze or a sharp spike into mobilization (panic). All practices here are gentle and gradual.

### Practice: Gentle activation through feet

**What to do:**
Sit and place your feet on the floor. Remove shoes if possible. Feel the contact of your feet with the floor. Slowly press your feet into the floor — not hard, about 20% of maximum. Hold for 5 seconds. Release. Repeat 5-10 times.

**Why it works:**
Freeze includes loss of contact with the body and with the "ground." Pressing feet into the floor is a gentle proprioceptive signal that activates sensory pathways without triggering a stress response.

### Practice: Sound and vibration

**What to do:**
Produce a long "mmm" or "voo" — on the exhale, in a low tone. Feel the vibration in your chest and throat. Repeat 5-10 times.

**Why it works:**
Vibration from vocalization stimulates the vagus nerve, which passes near the vocal cords. Additionally, deliberately producing sound is an act that moves you out of freeze's passivity.

### Practice: Temperature contrast on hands

**What to do:**
Hold your hands under warm (not hot!) water for 30 seconds. Then switch to cool (not ice-cold!) for 15 seconds. Back to warm. Pay attention to sensations.

**Why it works:**
Gentle temperature contrast is a sensory signal noticeable enough to "get through" to a dampened nervous system, but not sharp enough to trigger a stress response.

---

## If your pattern is "pendulum" (mobilization ↔ freeze)

Your nervous system swings between two extremes, bypassing connection mode. The task is to find the "middle."

### Practice: Tracking transitions

**What to do:**
Extended version of the basic observation practice. When you notice you've switched from one mode to another — note the moment of transition. What happened right before it? What was the trigger? Was there even a second of something between mobilization and freeze?

**Why:**
The "pendulum" pattern usually operates automatically and quickly. Slowing it down through observation gives the nervous system a chance to "pause" in an intermediate state — which often turns out to be closer to connection than to either extreme.

### Practice: "Safe enough"

**What to do:**
When you're in mobilization — instead of trying to "calm down," tell yourself: *"Right now I am safe enough."* Not "everything is fine" — that might not be true. Specifically "safe enough" — the minimum condition for the nervous system to begin considering a shift.

**Why it matters:**
The command "calm down" is often perceived by the nervous system as dismissing the threat and gets ignored. "Safe enough" is a more honest and therefore more effective signal.

## General recommendations

1. **Start with one practice.** Don't try to do everything at once. Pick the one that causes the least resistance.
2. **Consistency beats intensity.** 2 minutes every day is better than 30 minutes once a week.
3. **Don't evaluate "progress" daily.** First stable shifts may appear after 2-4 weeks.
4. **If a practice causes discomfort — stop.** The goal is gentle expansion, not pushing through.
5. **This is not a substitute for therapy.** If your pattern is linked to traumatic experience, working with a qualified therapist may be significantly more effective than self-guided practices.
