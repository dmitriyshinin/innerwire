# Questionnaire: Autonomic Profile

## How to use

This isn't a traditional test with right answers. It's a self-observation tool. It helps you notice what's happening with your nervous system in different situations.

Answer based on the last 2-3 months. Don't pick the "right" answer — pick the honest one.

## Part 1: Baseline mode

*"Where do I spend most of my time?"*

Read three descriptions. Estimate what percentage of a typical day you spend in each state. The total should roughly equal 100%.

### State A
You're calm but engaged. You can focus without much effort. Being around people doesn't drain you. Your body is relaxed but not "limp." If someone talks to you, you can listen and respond naturally. You feel in contact with the world around you.

**My percentage: _____%**

### State B
You're on edge. Maybe it shows as anxiety, irritability, impatience. Maybe as constant busyness, inability to stop. Your body is tense (shoulders, jaw, stomach). Hard to relax even when objectively everything is fine. Thoughts are racing, hard to fall asleep.

**My percentage: _____%**

### State C
Little or no energy. The world feels muted, distant. You can function, but as if on autopilot. No motivation. Scrolling your phone, watching shows — not because you enjoy it, but because you can't stop. Emotions are dulled.

**My percentage: _____%**

> State A = "Connection" mode
> State B = "Mobilization" mode
> State C = "Freeze" mode

## Part 2: Stress response

*"Where do I go when things get hard?"*

Imagine a typical stressful situation — conflict, deadline, bad news, unexpected problem. What happens in the first minutes? And after an hour?

### First reaction (minutes)

- [ ] I get activated: heart rate goes up, urge to act, anger or anxiety → **Mobilization**
- [ ] I shut down: go numb, thoughts get foggy, want to hide → **Freeze**
- [ ] I notice the stress but stay engaged, can think about solutions → **Connection**

### After one hour

- [ ] Still on edge, can't calm down → **Stuck in mobilization**
- [ ] Shut down, scrolling, no energy → **Dropped into freeze**
- [ ] Already passed, returned to normal → **Good recovery**

### Typical sequence

- [ ] Mobilization → Freeze (first wired, then crash)
- [ ] Freeze immediately (skipping mobilization)
- [ ] Mobilization without freeze (on edge for a long time, then gradually eases)
- [ ] Connection → brief mobilization → return to connection

## Part 3: Access to connection mode

*"How easy is it for me to reach a state of calm engagement?"*

Rate each statement from 1 (not me at all) to 5 (definitely me):

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | I sometimes feel calm and engaged at the same time — and it happens without special effort | ___ |
| 2 | I can listen to someone and truly hear them without thinking about my own stuff | ___ |
| 3 | I know the feeling of a relaxed body with a clear mind | ___ |
| 4 | After stress, I usually recover within hours, not days | ___ |
| 5 | I don't need special conditions (alcohol, perfect silence, total solitude) to relax | ___ |
| 6 | I can be around people and feel comfortable at least sometimes | ___ |
| 7 | I can enjoy simple things — food, a walk, a conversation | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 35**

- **28-35:** Connection mode is well-accessible
- **18-27:** Connection mode is accessible but unstable
- **7-17:** Connection mode is hard to access — this is the main area for work

## Part 4: Body markers

*"What is the body saying?"*

Check what's typical for you in your normal state (not during acute stress):

### Mobilization markers
- [ ] Tension in shoulders and/or neck
- [ ] Clenched jaw (especially during sleep)
- [ ] Shallow, rapid breathing
- [ ] Restlessness, need to move
- [ ] Trouble falling asleep (thoughts won't stop)
- [ ] Fast, hurried speech
- [ ] Tension in the stomach

### Freeze markers
- [ ] Heaviness in the body
- [ ] Often feeling cold (especially extremities)
- [ ] Quiet, monotone voice
- [ ] Brain fog
- [ ] Hard to initiate action, even simple ones
- [ ] Shallow but slow breathing
- [ ] Feeling disconnected from the body

### Connection markers
- [ ] Even, calm, reasonably deep breathing
- [ ] Body relaxed without feeling "mushy"
- [ ] Lively facial expressions, natural gestures
- [ ] Voice with intonation, not monotone
- [ ] Feeling present, "here and now"

## Interpretation

### Your approximate pattern

Gather results from all four parts. Look at:

1. **Part 1** tells you your baseline mode — where you "live"
2. **Part 2** tells you your stress strategy — where you go under pressure
3. **Part 3** tells you how available your resourceful state is
4. **Part 4** confirms (or corrects) your subjective assessment with body markers

Try describing your pattern in one or two sentences. For example:

- *"I spend most of my time in mobilization, under stress I drop into freeze, connection mode is available but unstable"*
- *"I'm mostly in freeze, stress disconnects me even more, connection mode is hard to reach"*
- *"Connection mode is available, but I easily slide into mobilization and take a long time to come out"*

### What's next

Now that you have your approximate pattern → go to [practices](practices.md) to learn what you can specifically do.

## About this questionnaire's accuracy

This is a self-observation tool, not a clinical test. It has not been validated and is not a diagnostic instrument. Its purpose is to help you notice what usually goes unnoticed.

For more precise autonomic profiling, objective methods exist: heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), skin conductance measurement. To learn more, see [sources](sources.md).
