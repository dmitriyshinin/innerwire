## Key works

### Dunn's Sensory Processing Framework

- **Dunn, W. (1997).** The impact of sensory processing abilities on the daily lives of young children and their families: A conceptual model. *Infants & Young Children, 9*(4), 23-35.

  The foundational paper introducing the two-axis model (neurological threshold x behavioral response) that forms the basis of this layer.

- **Brown, C., & Dunn, W. (2002).** *Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile: User's manual.* Psychological Corporation.

  The validated assessment instrument for measuring sensory processing patterns in adolescents and adults. A 60-item self-report yielding scores in four quadrants.

- **Dunn, W. (2001).** The sensations of everyday life: Empirical, theoretical, and pragmatic considerations. *American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 55*(6), 608-620.

- **Engel-Yeger, B., & Dunn, W. (2011).** The relationship between sensory processing difficulties and leisure activity preference of patients with chronic pain. *Disability and Rehabilitation, 33*(17-18), 1514-1522.

  Important study demonstrating that Dunn's model applies beyond developmental populations — chronic pain patients show distinct sensory processing profiles that influence their daily choices.

### Sensory Integration Theory

- **Ayres, A. J. (1972).** *Sensory Integration and Learning Disorders.* Western Psychological Services.

  The foundational text of sensory integration theory. Introduced the concept that the brain's ability to organize sensory input affects learning, behavior, and development.

- **Ayres, A. J. (1979).** *Sensory Integration and the Child.* Western Psychological Services.

  A more accessible presentation of SI theory for a broader audience.

### Diagnostic Taxonomy and Clinical Classification

- **Miller, L. J., Anzalone, M. E., Lane, S. J., Cermak, S. A., & Osten, E. T. (2007).** Concept evolution in sensory integration: A proposed nosology for diagnosis. *American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 61*(2), 135-140.

  A proposed diagnostic classification system distinguishing sensory modulation disorder, sensory-based motor disorder, and sensory discrimination disorder. More clinical precision than Dunn's quadrants.

### Research on sensory processing in specific populations

- **Ben-Sasson, A., Hen, L., Fluss, R., Cermak, S. A., Engel-Yeger, B., & Gal, E. (2009).** A meta-analysis of sensory modulation symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 39*, 1-11.

  Meta-analysis confirming that sensory modulation difficulties are significantly more prevalent in ASD populations, with over-responsivity being the most common pattern.

- **Schaaf, R. C., & Lane, A. E. (2015).** Toward a best-practice protocol for assessment of sensory features in ASD. *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45*(5), 1380-1395.

  A review proposing standardized assessment protocols. Highlights the gap between clinical practice and research in sensory assessment.

### Related constructs

- **Aron, E. N., & Aron, A. (1997).** Sensory-processing sensitivity and its relation to introversion and emotionality. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73*(2), 345-368.

  Introduces "Sensory Processing Sensitivity" (the "Highly Sensitive Person" concept) as a temperament trait. Overlaps with but is distinct from Dunn's framework — Aron focuses on emotional and cognitive processing depth, not just sensory threshold.

- **Greven, C. U., Lionetti, F., Booth, C., Aron, E. N., Fox, E., Schendan, H. E., ... & Homberg, J. (2019).** Sensory processing sensitivity in the context of environmental sensitivity: A critical review and development of research agenda. *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 98*, 287-305.

### Neurophysiology of sensory processing

- **Cascio, C. J. (2010).** Somatosensory processing in neurodevelopmental disorders. *Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders, 2*, 62-69.

- **Tavassoli, T., Miller, L. J., Schoen, S. A., Nielsen, D. M., & Baron-Cohen, S. (2014).** Sensory over-responsivity in adults with autism spectrum conditions. *Autism, 18*(4), 428-432.

### Sensory-based interventions

- **Schaaf, R. C., Benevides, T., Mailloux, Z., Faller, P., Hunt, J., van Hooydonk, E., ... & Kelly, D. (2014).** An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: A randomized trial. *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 44*(7), 1493-1506.

  One of the better-designed RCTs on sensory integration therapy, showing improvements in goal attainment. However, effect sizes were moderate and long-term outcomes unclear.

- **May-Benson, T. A., & Koomar, J. A. (2010).** Systematic review of the research evidence examining the effectiveness of interventions using a sensory integrative approach for children. *American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 64*(3), 403-414.

## Criticism and limitations

### On "Sensory Processing Disorder"

- **American Academy of Pediatrics. (2012).** Policy statement: Sensory integration therapies for children with developmental and behavioral disorders. *Pediatrics, 129*(6), 1186-1189.

  The AAP cautions against diagnosing SPD as a standalone condition and notes limited evidence for sensory integration therapy. This remains a significant professional disagreement.

### On sensory integration therapy

- **Lang, R., O'Reilly, M., Healy, O., Rispoli, M., Lydon, H., Streusand, W., ... & Giesbers, S. (2012).** Sensory integration therapy for autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review. *Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 6*(3), 1004-1018.

  Systematic review finding insufficient evidence to support sensory integration therapy for ASD. Methodological quality of existing studies was generally low.

### On measurement

- **Parham, L. D., Ecker, C., Miller Kuhaneck, H., Henry, D. A., & Glennon, T. J. (2007).** *Sensory Processing Measure (SPM).* Western Psychological Services.

  An alternative to the Sensory Profile, offering a different measurement approach. The existence of multiple incompatible instruments reflects the field's measurement challenges.

## Note on sources

InnerWire strives for maximum scientific honesty:

- We cite peer-reviewed publications
- We include criticism alongside supporting research
- Most sensory processing research has been conducted on children and clinical populations (especially ASD). The evidence base for neurotypical adults is thinner. We acknowledge this.
- If a claim is based on preliminary data or clinical consensus rather than strong experimental evidence, we note it
- The model will be updated as new research appears
