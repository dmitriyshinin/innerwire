# Layer 2: Sensory Profile

> How your nervous system filters the world — and why you can't stand that fluorescent light while your colleague doesn't even notice it

## Contents

- [Description](description.md) — what sensory processing is and how the two axes work
- [Questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — map your sensory patterns
- [Practices](practices.md) — what to do with the results
- [Sources](sources.md) — scientific basis

## Quick start

1. Read the [description](description.md) — 10 minutes
2. Take the [self-observation questionnaire](questionnaire.md) — 10 minutes
3. Check the [recommended practices](practices.md) for your sensory pattern

## Connection to other layers

- **Layer 0 (Autonomic Profile)** sets the foundation: your nervous system's baseline state affects how you process sensory input. Someone stuck in mobilization mode will experience sensory stimuli more intensely. Someone in freeze may barely register them. Your autonomic state modulates your sensory thresholds in real time.
- **Layer 2 (Sensory Profile)** adds a new dimension: not just *how activated* your nervous system is, but *how it filters incoming information* from the world. Two people in the same autonomic state can have very different sensory experiences of the same environment.
- Layers work together: understanding your autonomic pattern (Layer 0) helps you interpret your sensory reactions. A noisy cafe might push you toward mobilization not because of stress, but because your sensory threshold for auditory input is low.
