# Questionnaire: Sensory Profile

## How to use

This is not a clinical test. It's a self-observation tool that helps you notice how your nervous system processes sensory information across different modalities and situations.

Answer based on your typical experience over the last 2-3 months. Don't pick the "ideal" answer — pick the honest one.

**Scale:** 1 = almost never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = almost always

## Part 1: Sensory Sensitivity and Registration

*"How much do I notice?"*

These questions map where you fall on the threshold axis — how much stimulation your nervous system needs before it responds.

### Auditory (hearing)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | I notice background sounds that others don't seem to hear (humming, ticking, distant traffic) | ___ |
| 2 | I get distracted or bothered by conversations happening nearby, even when I'm trying to focus on something else | ___ |
| 3 | Sudden or unexpected sounds (a door slamming, a car horn) startle me more than they seem to startle others | ___ |

### Visual (sight)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 4 | Bright or flickering lights bother me (fluorescent lights, oncoming headlights, screen glare) | ___ |
| 5 | I notice small visual details — a picture hanging slightly crooked, a subtle color change, a typo on a sign | ___ |
| 6 | Visually "busy" environments (cluttered spaces, lots of movement, flashing screens) feel overwhelming | ___ |

### Tactile (touch)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 7 | Certain clothing textures, tags, or seams bother me to the point where I can't ignore them | ___ |
| 8 | I'm particular about the texture of fabrics, bedding, or items I touch regularly | ___ |
| 9 | Light, unexpected touch (someone brushing past me in a crowd) is unpleasant or startling | ___ |

### Olfactory and gustatory (smell and taste)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 10 | I notice smells that other people don't seem to detect | ___ |
| 11 | Strong smells (perfume, cleaning products, certain foods) are distracting or unpleasant even at levels others find normal | ___ |
| 12 | I'm sensitive to food textures or flavors — I notice the subtle taste difference in, say, two brands of the same product | ___ |

### Vestibular (movement and balance)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 13 | I feel uncomfortable or disoriented with rapid movements (spinning, fast elevators, winding roads) | ___ |
| 14 | I prefer activities where I can keep my body stable rather than those involving lots of movement changes | ___ |

### Proprioceptive (body position and pressure)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 15 | I notice quickly when my body is in an uncomfortable position and need to adjust | ___ |
| 16 | I'm aware of physical tension in my body (clenched jaw, tight shoulders) as it builds, not just after it's extreme | ___ |

**Part 1 scoring:**

Add up your scores for all 16 questions.

- **55-80:** High sensitivity / low threshold — your nervous system picks up on a lot. You likely resonate with the "Sensory Sensitivity" or "Sensation Avoiding" descriptions.
- **35-54:** Moderate — you notice some things more than others. Look at which modalities scored highest to find your sensitive areas.
- **16-34:** Low sensitivity / high threshold — your nervous system filters out a lot. You likely resonate with the "Low Registration" or "Sensation Seeking" descriptions.

## Part 2: Behavioral Response

*"What do I do about it?"*

These questions map where you fall on the response axis — do you passively experience sensory input, or do you actively manage it?

### Active management (avoiding or controlling)

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 17 | I actively create routines and environments to minimize sensory surprises (same seat, same route, controlled lighting) | ___ |
| 18 | I avoid certain places, events, or situations specifically because of their sensory characteristics (too loud, too bright, too crowded) | ___ |
| 19 | I use tools to manage sensory input (noise-cancelling headphones, sunglasses indoors, specific clothing brands) | ___ |
| 20 | I feel uneasy or anxious when I can't control the sensory environment around me | ___ |

### Active seeking

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 21 | I seek out intense sensory experiences — loud music, spicy food, extreme sports, very hot or cold water | ___ |
| 22 | I fidget, tap, chew, or move my body when sitting still for long periods — my body seems to need the extra input | ___ |
| 23 | I get bored or restless in calm, quiet, predictable environments | ___ |
| 24 | I enjoy strong flavors, bold patterns, intense physical sensations — "mild" versions of things feel like nothing | ___ |

### Passive response

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 25 | I tend to go along with whatever sensory environment I'm in without trying to change it, even if it's not ideal | ___ |
| 26 | Others sometimes point out things in my environment (noises, smells, temperature) that I hadn't noticed | ___ |
| 27 | I don't usually think about adjusting lighting, sound, or temperature — it doesn't occur to me | ___ |
| 28 | I sometimes realize I've been uncomfortable (too hot, in a bad posture, in a noisy room) for a while without noticing | ___ |

**Part 2 scoring:**

Look at which group scored highest:

- **Highest in Active Management (Q17-20):** You lean toward **Sensation Avoiding** behavior. You actively organize your world to control input.
- **Highest in Active Seeking (Q21-24):** You lean toward **Sensation Seeking** behavior. You actively pursue intensity.
- **Highest in Passive Response (Q25-28):** You lean toward a **passive** behavioral style. Whether you're in Sensory Sensitivity or Low Registration depends on your Part 1 score.

## Part 3: Cross-modality check

*"Where are my specific peaks and valleys?"*

For each sensory modality, mark whether you lean toward sensitivity or non-registration. This is important because most people are not uniform.

| Modality | I'm more sensitive than average (1-5) | I miss or ignore this more than average (1-5) |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Sound | ___ | ___ |
| Light/Vision | ___ | ___ |
| Touch/Texture | ___ | ___ |
| Smell | ___ | ___ |
| Taste/Food texture | ___ | ___ |
| Movement/Balance | ___ | ___ |
| Body position/Pressure | ___ | ___ |
| Temperature | ___ | ___ |

## Interpretation

### Your approximate sensory map

Combine results from all three parts:

1. **Part 1** tells you your overall threshold tendency — where your nervous system sits on the sensitivity axis
2. **Part 2** tells you your behavioral strategy — what you do about the input you get
3. **Part 3** reveals your modality-specific pattern — which senses are most and least reactive

Try describing your sensory profile in a few sentences. For example:

- *"High sensitivity to sound and light, moderate for touch. I actively avoid noisy environments but passively endure visual clutter. I seek out intense physical exercise (proprioceptive seeking)."*
- *"Low registration across most modalities — I miss a lot. But I'm sensitive to smell. I don't actively seek input in general, except through fidgeting."*
- *"Moderate threshold overall, but a strong sensation seeker. I get bored easily and need intense experiences to feel engaged."*

### Combining with Layer 0

Your sensory profile interacts with your autonomic pattern:

- If your Layer 0 pattern is **predominantly mobilization**, your sensory thresholds are likely running lower right now (stress makes you more reactive to stimuli)
- If your Layer 0 pattern is **predominantly freeze**, you may be in temporary low registration — not because your baseline is high-threshold, but because your nervous system has dampened everything
- A stably **connected** autonomic state gives you the most accurate sensory self-assessment

Now that you have your approximate sensory map, go to [practices](practices.md) to learn what you can specifically do.

## About this questionnaire's accuracy

This is a self-observation tool, not a validated clinical instrument. It draws on the structure of the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) by Brown & Dunn (2002) but is simplified for self-exploration, not diagnosis.

For formal assessment, the AASP is the most widely used validated tool. It is a 60-item self-report measure that can be administered by an occupational therapist. To learn more, see [sources](sources.md).
