# Practices: Sensory Profile

## Principle

The goal is not to "fix" your sensory processing — your thresholds are part of your neurology. The goal is to understand your patterns well enough to work with them: reduce unnecessary overwhelm, increase useful input, and design your environment to support how your nervous system actually works, rather than how you think it should work.

## Practice for everyone: Sensory diary

**For whom:** any sensory pattern. This is the foundational practice everyone should start with.

**What to do:**
For one week, keep a brief sensory log. Three times a day (morning, midday, evening), take 60 seconds and note:

1. **What am I noticing right now?** (Sounds, light, body sensations, smells, textures)
2. **What is bothering me, if anything?** (Be specific: not "noise" but "the neighbor's music through the wall")
3. **What is missing?** (Do I feel understimulated, bored, "flat"?)
4. **How is my energy?** (Wired? Drained? Zoned out? Fine?)

Keep it brief — one line per question is enough.

**Why it works:**
Most people have no awareness of how sensory input affects their state throughout the day. The diary creates a data set from your actual life. After a week, patterns become visible: maybe you're consistently drained after open-plan office mornings, or consistently restless after quiet evenings. These patterns are the basis for everything that follows.

**Scientific basis:** Self-monitoring is one of the most robust interventions in behavioral science. Awareness of a pattern is the first step to modifying it (this principle underlies cognitive-behavioral approaches across many domains).

```
Date: ___  Time: ___
What I notice (senses): ___
What's bothering me: ___
What feels missing: ___
Energy level: [wired / fine / drained / zoned out]
```

## If your pattern is predominantly Sensory Sensitivity

Your nervous system picks up on everything, and the input accumulates. The goal is not to become less sensitive — that's not how it works. The goal is to give your system recovery time and to stop treating your sensitivity as a problem.

### Practice: Sensory rest breaks

**What to do:**
Build 5-10 minute "sensory rest" periods into your day. Find a space with minimal input: dim lighting, quiet, no screens, no strong smells. Close your eyes if comfortable. Don't meditate, don't do breathing exercises — just remove input. Let your nervous system's inbox empty out.

Schedule these proactively, not just when you're already overwhelmed. If you wait until you're fried, it's too late — you need more recovery time than a quick break provides.

**Why it works:**
Sensory habituation (the brain's ability to tune out persistent stimuli) works less efficiently in people with low thresholds. What happens instead is cumulative sensitization — each additional input adds to the total load rather than being filtered out. Regular sensory breaks prevent the load from reaching the threshold where overwhelm kicks in.

**Practical tip:** If you can't find a quiet space, noise-reducing earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones (even without music) significantly lower auditory input. A simple eye mask works for visual.

### Practice: Post-exposure decompression

**What to do:**
After high-stimulation events (a party, a workday in an open office, a concert, a busy shopping trip), deliberately schedule decompression time. This is not optional "self-care" — it's neurological maintenance. The amount of time depends on the intensity: 30 minutes after a busy day, an hour or more after something intense.

During decompression: low sensory input, activities that feel genuinely calming (not just numbing). A walk in nature works for many people because natural environments tend to have softer, more predictable sensory patterns than urban ones.

**Why it works:**
Research on sensory modulation (Miller et al., 2007) shows that people with low thresholds take longer to return to baseline after high-stimulation exposure. Planning decompression acknowledges this reality instead of ignoring it.

## If your pattern is predominantly Sensation Avoiding

You already know what bothers you, and you've built systems to manage it. The risk is that your world gets smaller and smaller. The goal is to maintain your systems while gently expanding your tolerance zone.

### Practice: Gradual exposure with control

**What to do:**
Pick one sensory situation you currently avoid that you wish you could tolerate better (a type of restaurant, public transport, a social setting). Expose yourself to it in a controlled way:

1. Start with short durations (15-20 minutes)
2. Bring your tools (headphones, sunglasses, whatever you need)
3. Have an exit plan — knowing you can leave reduces anxiety, which lowers sensory reactivity
4. Gradually increase duration over weeks

The key word is *gradual*. This is not "flooding" or pushing through discomfort. It's carefully titrated expansion.

**Why it works:**
Avoidance patterns, once established, tend to self-reinforce: you avoid a situation, so you never learn that you might tolerate it with the right supports. Gradual exposure with maintained control allows the nervous system to recalibrate without overwhelm. This is the same principle underlying exposure therapy, adapted for sensory rather than anxiety contexts.

### Practice: Sensory "menu"

**What to do:**
Create a written list of sensory inputs that feel good, organized by modality. Not just "what doesn't bother me" — what actually feels pleasant. Soft blanket textures. The smell of a specific tea. Warm water on your hands. A particular playlist.

When you need to manage your sensory state, you have a menu to choose from instead of just removing all input (which can tip into understimulation).

**Why it works:**
Sensation avoiders often focus exclusively on reducing negative input and forget to add positive input. A purely subtractive approach can lead to sensory deprivation, which paradoxically makes the nervous system more reactive over time. Positive sensory input activates the ventral vagal system (Layer 0 connection mode) and improves overall regulation.

## If your pattern is predominantly Sensation Seeking

Your nervous system is hungry, and you need to feed it. The goal is to find healthy, sustainable ways to get the intensity you need without relying on increasingly extreme input or burning yourself out.

### Practice: Structured sensory diet

**What to do:**
A "sensory diet" (a term from occupational therapy) means deliberately scheduling high-intensity sensory input throughout your day, rather than waiting until you're desperately bored or restless.

Build a daily schedule that includes:
- **Proprioceptive input:** heavy work — exercise with resistance, carrying heavy things, push-ups, yoga poses that involve pushing against the floor
- **Vestibular input:** movement-based activities — swinging, spinning, dancing, any exercise that changes head position
- **Tactile input:** textured objects to handle, varied surfaces to touch
- **Other modalities as needed:** strong flavors at meals, music with bass during work, bright visual environments

Spread these across the day rather than concentrating them. Think of it as regular meals rather than one enormous feast.

**Why it works:**
Sensation seekers often rely on random, spontaneous input (fidgeting, impulsive novelty-seeking, risky behavior). A structured approach satisfies the neurological need proactively. Research on sensory diets, primarily from occupational therapy, shows that scheduled input can reduce disruptive seeking behavior and improve attention.

### Practice: Intensity cycling

**What to do:**
Instead of maintaining constant high stimulation (which leads to tolerance and needing ever more), deliberately alternate between high-intensity and moderate-intensity periods. For example: 45 minutes of focused work with strong background music and a fidget tool, followed by 15 minutes of moderate, quieter activity. Then back to intensity.

**Why it works:**
Constant high stimulation leads to habituation — your nervous system adjusts and the input no longer registers, so you need more. Cycling prevents full habituation by introducing variation. You get the intensity you need without the escalation spiral.

## If your pattern is predominantly Low Registration

A lot of the world goes by without you noticing. The goal is to gently increase your awareness of sensory input, not to force alertness, but to help your nervous system catch more of what's happening.

### Practice: Deliberate sensory check-in

**What to do:**
Set 3-4 alarms throughout the day. When the alarm sounds, stop and do a systematic body and environment scan:

1. What do I hear right now? (List three sounds)
2. What do I see that I hadn't consciously noticed? (List three things)
3. What does my body feel like right now? (Temperature, position, tension, comfort)
4. Is there a smell or taste I hadn't registered?

This takes 60-90 seconds. The alarm is essential because without external prompting, you won't remember to check — that's the nature of low registration.

**Why it works:**
Low registration means your nervous system's default is to not forward sensory data to conscious awareness. Deliberate, repeated check-ins train the brain to allocate more attention to sensory channels. Over time, this can modestly increase how much you notice without deliberate effort — though the change is gradual.

### Practice: Amplified sensory anchors

**What to do:**
Use stronger-than-typical sensory cues to anchor your attention to the present moment:
- Strong flavors (ginger, mint, citrus) as a wake-up signal during the day
- Textured objects in your pocket to fidget with (awareness through touch)
- Brighter task lighting at your workspace
- Music with a clear beat during tasks that require focus
- Cold water on wrists when you need to "come back" from zoning out

These are not substitutes for awareness — they're scaffolding. External signals that your nervous system is more likely to register, which then triggers broader awareness.

**Why it works:**
If the signal needs to be stronger for your system to register it, provide stronger signals. This is not a workaround — it's accommodation, the same way glasses accommodate poor vision. There's no merit in trying to notice things at a threshold your neurology doesn't support.

## Environmental design

Regardless of your pattern, your physical environment has a constant effect on your sensory state. Small changes can have disproportionate impact.

### Workspace

- **Lighting:** Fluorescent lights are among the most common sensory stressors. If you can't change the overheads, a desk lamp with warm light and dimmed monitors help. For low registration: brighter, cooler light improves alertness.
- **Sound:** Open offices are a sensory nightmare for low-threshold people. Options: noise-cancelling headphones, white noise machines, earplugs during focus periods. For sensation seekers: background music with a consistent beat can improve focus.
- **Seating:** A chair that provides proprioceptive feedback (firm, with good back support) helps both sensation seekers (grounding) and sensitive individuals (predictable input). Wobble cushions or standing desks can serve sensation seekers.
- **Visual field:** Reduce clutter for sensitive profiles. Add visual variety for seekers.

### Home

- **Sleep environment:** Prioritize this. Blackout curtains, consistent temperature, minimal sound. Weighted blankets provide proprioceptive input that calms many nervous system types.
- **Transition spaces:** Create a sensory "airlock" between the outside world and your home. A routine at the door — removing shoes, changing clothes, washing hands — signals to the nervous system that the sensory rules have changed.
- **Personal sanctuary:** At least one area with sensory settings you fully control. This is not a luxury — it's a regulation tool.

## General recommendations

1. **Start with the sensory diary.** Don't skip this. Without data from your actual life, you're guessing.
2. **Address your most disruptive modality first.** If sound is what wrecks you, work on sound. Don't try to optimize everything simultaneously.
3. **Accommodation is not weakness.** Using earplugs, sunglasses, fidget tools, or weighted blankets is not "giving in" to sensitivity — it's providing your nervous system what it needs.
4. **Watch for autonomic interaction.** If your Layer 0 pattern is mobilization-dominant, expect your sensory thresholds to run lower than your baseline. Address the autonomic state first — sometimes the "sensory problem" resolves when you're no longer in fight-or-flight.
5. **Consistency beats intensity.** A daily sensory diet works better than weekly heroic interventions.
6. **This is not a substitute for professional help.** If sensory difficulties significantly impair your daily functioning (you can't work, can't maintain relationships, can't leave the house), consult an occupational therapist with training in sensory processing.
