# Your nervous system as a filter: sensory processing

## The core idea in one sentence

Your nervous system has its own settings for how much sensory input it needs to register a signal and what you do about it — and these settings shape your daily life far more than you realize.

## Sensory processing

Right now, as you read this, your brain is processing an enormous amount of sensory information. Light hitting your retinas. The feel of the chair against your back. Background sounds — a hum from the fridge, traffic outside, your own breathing. The temperature of the air. The weight of your body against the floor.

Most of this never reaches your conscious awareness. Your nervous system filters it out. But here's the thing: the filter settings are different for everyone.

Some people walk into a room and immediately notice the buzz of a fluorescent light. Others don't hear it even when it's pointed out. Some people find the tag on a shirt intolerable. Others forget they're wearing one. Some people crave loud concerts, roller coasters, intense flavors. Others find a moderately busy restaurant overwhelming.

This isn't about being "dramatic" or "tough." It's neurology. Your nervous system has genuine, measurable differences in how it processes sensory information.

## Two axes

Winnie Dunn, an occupational therapy researcher, proposed a model that maps sensory processing along two axes. It's straightforward and backed by decades of research.

### Axis 1: Neurological threshold

How much sensory stimulation does your nervous system need before it registers a signal?

**Low threshold** means your nervous system responds to small amounts of input. You notice things others miss. The subtle flicker of a screen. A faint smell in a room. The slight change in someone's tone of voice. The seam in your sock.

In daily life, this looks like:
- Noticing background noises that others tune out
- Being bothered by clothing textures, labels, certain fabrics
- Needing to turn down the brightness on your screen
- Feeling overwhelmed in places like shopping malls or busy streets
- Picking up on subtle social cues or shifts in atmosphere

**High threshold** means your nervous system needs more input before it responds. You might not notice things until they're quite intense. The music has to be pretty loud before you feel you're really hearing it. You might walk past a strong smell without registering it.

In daily life, this looks like:
- Not noticing when someone enters the room
- Being told "how can you eat that — it's so spicy?" when it tastes normal to you
- Working comfortably in environments others find noisy or chaotic
- Not realizing you're cold until someone points out you're shivering
- Missing subtle social signals — not because you don't care, but because they genuinely don't register

**Important:** threshold is not uniform across all senses. You can have a low threshold for sound (every noise bothers you) and a high threshold for touch (you barely feel a light tap). This is common — most people have mixed profiles.

### Axis 2: Behavioral response strategy

What do you DO about the sensory input you're getting?

**Passive strategy** means you experience whatever comes. You don't actively seek stimulation, and you don't actively avoid it. You respond to the sensory input as it happens.

**Active strategy** means you take deliberate action. You either seek out specific sensory input or you actively arrange your environment to control it.

## Four quadrants

These two axes create four zones. Think of them as regions on a 2D map, not as four boxes you get sorted into.

### Sensory Sensitivity (low threshold + passive)

The princess and the pea.

Your nervous system picks up on everything, and you just... experience it. You notice the hum, the flicker, the weird texture, the faint smell — but you don't necessarily do anything about it. You endure it, or you're distracted by it, or it builds up until you're overwhelmed.

**What this looks like:**
- You're the person who says "does anyone else hear that?" and nobody does
- Crowded, noisy places are draining — not because you chose to notice everything, but because you can't not notice
- Tags in clothing, certain fabrics, seams — they bother you, even if you don't cut them out
- You startle easily at unexpected sounds
- After a day of too much stimulation, you feel completely drained — not just tired, but depleted

**The key feature:** high sensitivity, but you don't systematically organize your life around it. The world just comes at you, and you feel it all.

### Sensation Avoiding (low threshold + active)

The architect of control.

Same low threshold — you pick up on everything. But unlike the sensitive pattern, you actively do something about it. You create systems, routines, and environments that minimize unwanted input.

**What this looks like:**
- You have specific routines and get uncomfortable when they're disrupted
- You choose restaurants based on noise level, not just food
- Noise-cancelling headphones are a survival tool, not a luxury
- You sit in the same seat, take the same route, eat familiar foods — because novelty is a sensory risk
- You say "no" to social events if the setting feels unpredictable
- You've arranged your home to be exactly how you need it — lighting, sounds, textures

**The key feature:** you've learned that the world is too much, so you actively manage the input. This can be very functional (you know exactly what you need) but can also shrink your world if taken to an extreme.

### Sensation Seeking (high threshold + active)

The intensity hunter.

Your nervous system needs a lot of stimulation to feel engaged. And you go get it. You don't wait for the world to stimulate you — you create or find the intensity you need.

**What this looks like:**
- You turn the music up — louder, not softer
- You crave new experiences, novel foods, unfamiliar places
- You're drawn to extreme sports, spicy food, loud concerts, intense movies
- You fidget, tap, chew on pens — your body is always looking for sensory input
- You get bored easily in calm, quiet settings
- You might add hot sauce to everything or take the coldest possible shower
- Multitasking feels natural — one input stream is never enough

**The key feature:** your nervous system is hungry. Quiet, still, predictable environments feel like sensory starvation. You're not "restless" as a personality trait — your neurology genuinely needs more input.

### Low Registration (high threshold + passive)

The one who misses the memo.

Your nervous system has a high threshold and you don't actively seek input to compensate. The result: things happen around you and you genuinely don't notice them.

**What this looks like:**
- You don't notice the temperature changed until you're very hot or very cold
- People say your name several times before you respond — you weren't ignoring them, you literally didn't hear
- You bump into things or seem "clumsy" — not due to motor problems, but because you don't register spatial input as quickly
- You might miss that you've been sitting in an uncomfortable position for hours
- You appear "zoned out" or "in your own world" — this isn't deliberate withdrawal, it's genuine non-registration
- You might not notice you're hungry until you're shaking

**The key feature:** this is NOT laziness, inattention, or not caring. Your nervous system genuinely has a high bar for what gets through. Without active effort to seek input, a lot of the sensory world simply doesn't register.

## This is not a type

Nobody lives in one quadrant. Repeat: nobody. Dunn's model describes tendencies that can vary by:

- **Sensory modality** — you might be a sensation seeker for sound (loud music, please) and sensation avoiding for touch (don't hug me)
- **Context** — at work you might be in low registration mode (tuning out the open office) and at home switch to sensory sensitivity (every sound your neighbor makes)
- **Autonomic state** — when you're in mobilization (Layer 0), your thresholds shift lower. When you're in freeze, they shift higher. The layers interact.
- **Time of day and fatigue** — your sensory tolerance narrows when you're tired
- **Life phase** — sensory patterns can shift over years, with hormonal changes, aging, or accumulated stress

The model gives you a language and a map. Not a label.

## Common patterns

Most people have a "home base" — the quadrant they spend the most time in — with significant presence in one or two others. Some typical combinations:

- **Sensitivity + Avoiding:** very common together. You notice everything AND you've built systems to manage it. You know your limits well.
- **Seeking + Low Registration:** also common. You need intense input AND you miss subtle signals. Can look like someone who's "always on" but misses quiet cues.
- **Sensitivity in one modality, Seeking in another:** extremely common. Hates loud noise, loves intense physical exercise. Can't stand scratchy fabrics, puts hot sauce on everything.

## What shapes your sensory profile

- **Genetics** — sensory processing patterns have a significant hereditary component
- **Neurological development** — early brain development sets the initial calibration
- **Experience** — chronic exposure to high stimulation can shift thresholds; so can sensory deprivation
- **Current autonomic state** — your Layer 0 pattern directly modulates sensory processing
- **Age** — some thresholds shift with age (hearing loss raises auditory threshold, for example)
- **Stress and fatigue** — acute stress temporarily lowers thresholds; chronic fatigue can go either way

## What's next

1. Take the [self-observation questionnaire](questionnaire.md) to map your sensory patterns
2. Check the [practices](practices.md) suited to your profile
3. When you're ready to go deeper — move on to the next layer

<summary>In-depth: Dunn's Model, Ayres' Sensory Integration, and criticism</summary>

### Winnie Dunn's Sensory Processing Framework

The model described above is based on the Sensory Processing Framework developed by Winnie Dunn, primarily through her work at the University of Kansas. The framework first appeared in the literature in the late 1990s and was formalized with the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) assessment tool published in 2002 with Catana Brown.

Dunn's key contribution was combining two dimensions that had been studied separately:

1. **Neurological threshold** — the amount of stimulation required for a neuron or neuron system to respond. This is a real neurophysiological parameter, not a metaphor. Different people's nervous systems genuinely require different levels of input to fire.

2. **Behavioral response** — what the person does in relation to their threshold. This adds the active/passive dimension, which accounts for why two people with the same threshold can look very different in daily life.

The AASP is a 60-item self-report questionnaire that yields scores in each of the four quadrants. It has been used in research across populations including neurotypical adults, individuals with autism, ADHD, chronic pain, schizophrenia, and various other conditions.

### A. Jean Ayres and Sensory Integration Theory

Dunn's work builds on a longer tradition started by A. Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist and neuroscientist who developed Sensory Integration Theory in the 1960s-70s. Ayres focused on how the brain organizes and interprets sensory information for functional use.

Ayres' key ideas:

- **Sensory integration** is an active neurological process — the brain doesn't just receive input, it organizes it into a coherent picture that enables adaptive response.
- **Some people have difficulty with this integration** — not because of sensory organ damage, but because of how the brain processes the input. This can affect motor planning, emotional regulation, learning, and behavior.
- **The "hidden senses"** — Ayres drew attention to proprioception (sense of body position) and the vestibular system (sense of movement and balance), which had been largely neglected. These are at least as important for daily functioning as the five traditional senses.
- **Sensory-based intervention** — providing specific types of sensory input can help the nervous system organize itself better over time (neuroplasticity, before that term was popular).

### Miller et al.: Diagnostic Taxonomy

Lucy Jane Miller and colleagues proposed a diagnostic nosology in 2007 that distinguishes three main categories of sensory processing difficulty:

1. **Sensory Modulation Disorder** — difficulty regulating responses to sensory input (over-responsive, under-responsive, or seeking)
2. **Sensory-Based Motor Disorder** — difficulty with posture or motor planning due to sensory processing issues
3. **Sensory Discrimination Disorder** — difficulty interpreting the qualities of sensory stimuli

This taxonomy offers more clinical precision than Dunn's quadrants, but the two frameworks are complementary: Dunn's model describes patterns in the general population, while Miller's focuses on when those patterns cross into clinically significant difficulty.

### Criticism and limitations

The sensory processing field has important limitations that deserve honesty:

**Research population bias.** The vast majority of sensory processing research has been conducted on children, particularly children with autism spectrum disorder. Research on neurotypical adults is growing but still relatively thin. The AASP is one of the few validated tools for the adult population.

**"Sensory Processing Disorder" is not in the DSM.** Despite decades of advocacy, SPD has not been recognized as a standalone diagnosis in the DSM-5. The American Academy of Pediatrics has cautioned against using SPD as a diagnosis, arguing that the evidence base is insufficient and that sensory symptoms may be better understood as features of other conditions (ADHD, ASD, anxiety). This is a genuine debate, not a settled question.

**Measurement challenges.** Sensory processing is typically measured through self-report or caregiver report, which introduces subjectivity. Neurophysiological measures exist (e.g., EEG sensory gating, autonomic responses to stimuli) but don't always correlate neatly with self-reported experience.

**Ayres' theory** — while foundational and clinically influential — was developed before modern neuroimaging. Some of her specific neurological claims have not been confirmed by subsequent research. The clinical practice of "sensory integration therapy" has mixed evidence: some studies support it, others show it is no more effective than other interventions.

**Overlap with temperament.** Some researchers argue that "sensory sensitivity" overlaps substantially with the temperament trait of Sensory Processing Sensitivity (Aron & Aron, 1997, "highly sensitive person"), and that the constructs should be integrated rather than treated as separate.

In InnerWire, we use Dunn's framework as the most practical and well-structured model for understanding individual differences in sensory processing. But we hold it as a useful map, not as settled science. The model will be updated as research evolves.
