# InnerWire — Science-Based Open Framework for Self-Awareness

*Inner — internal. Wire — wiring. Your inner wiring: nervous system, perception, response patterns.*

## What is this

InnerWire is a model of individual differences built on measurable parameters of the nervous system, perception, and behavior. Unlike popular typologies (MBTI, Socionics, Human Design), InnerWire doesn't offer pseudoscientific "types." Instead, it offers a profile across several axes, each backed by peer-reviewed research.

## Who it's for

- People who want to understand themselves but can't bring themselves to believe in astrology
- People who value evidence and want to see citations
- People looking not just for descriptions but for actionable practices
- Professionals who need an integrative framework

## Principles

1. **Scientific basis** — every claim is backed by references to peer-reviewed research
2. **Layers of complexity** — each layer is self-sufficient and useful on its own
3. **Spectrums, not types** — people vary along continuums, not discrete categories
4. **Dynamic** — your profile isn't a sentence; it changes with state, context, and practice
5. **Open** — the model is open for critique, contribution, and evolution

## Model structure

| Layer | Name | Core idea | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | [Autonomic Profile](model/layer-0-autonomic/) | Three modes of the nervous system | 🟡 draft |
| 1 | [Interoceptive Profile](model/layer-1-interoception/) | How well you sense your own body | 🟡 draft |
| 2 | [Sensory Profile](model/layer-2-sensory/) | How you process sensory information | 🟡 draft |
| 3 | [Attachment Pattern](model/layer-3-attachment/) | How you build closeness with others | 🟡 draft |
| 4 | [Allostatic Load](model/layer-4-allostatic-load/) | Current level of accumulated stress | 🟡 draft |

**Each layer includes:**
- Description accessible without specialized education
- In-depth material for those who want to go deeper
- Questionnaire / method for determining your profile
- Practices tailored to your profile
- List of scientific sources

## How to read

**If you're new here** — start with [Layer 0: Autonomic Profile](model/layer-0-autonomic/). It's self-sufficient and can already give you useful information about yourself.

**If you're a professional** — check the [sources](model/layer-0-autonomic/sources.md) and [bibliography](../research/bibliography.md).

**If you want to contribute** — read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
