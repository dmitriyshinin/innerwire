# Practices: Autonomic Profile

## Principle

The goal isn't to "fix" yourself but to expand access to connection mode and increase flexibility in switching between modes. You're not "broken" if you live in mobilization or shutdown — your nervous system adapted to the experience you've had. But adaptations can be updated.

## Practice for everyone: Mode observation

**For whom:** any pattern. This is the foundational practice to start with.

**What to do:**
Three times a day — morning, midday, and evening — pause whatever you're doing for 30 seconds. Ask yourself one question: *"Which mode am I in right now — connection, mobilization, or shutdown?"*

No need to change anything. No need to "fix" yourself. Just notice. If you want, write down one word.

**Why it works:**
The ability to notice your own state activates the ventral vagus — the part of the nervous system responsible for connection mode. Observing your nervous system slightly shifts you toward connection. This isn't a metaphor — it's a neurophysiological process.

**Duration:** minimum 1 week, can be continued indefinitely.

## If your pattern is predominantly mobilization

Your nervous system habitually stays in "there's a threat, must act" mode. The task is to give it a signal of safety.

### Practice: Extended exhale

**What to do:**
Breathe normally but extend your exhale. If inhale is 3 counts — exhale for 5-6. No straining, no breath holding. Just exhale a bit longer. 2-3 minutes. Can be done anywhere.

**Why it works:**
Inhale activates the sympathetic system (mobilization), exhale activates the parasympathetic (braking). By extending the exhale, you literally shift the balance toward braking. One of the best-documented ways to voluntarily influence the autonomic nervous system.

### Practice: Orienting response

**What to do:**
Slowly turn your head and look around. Slowly. As if you're in an unfamiliar but safe place, curiously exploring it. Rest your gaze on each object for 3-5 seconds. Note color, shape, texture. 1-2 minutes.

**Why it works:**
In mobilization, attention narrows — you fixate on the threat. Slowly scanning the environment is behavior characteristic of a state of safety. Body and nervous system are bidirectionally linked: not only does state affect behavior, but behavior affects state.

### Practice: Tension release through movement

**What to do:**
Any intense movement for 5-10 minutes: brisk walking, running, push-ups, dancing, shaking. After — stop and stand or sit quietly for 2-3 minutes, observing your sensations.

**Why it works:**
Mobilization prepares the body for physical action. If no action occurs, the energy gets "stuck" as tension. Giving it a physical outlet allows the nervous system to complete the stress response cycle.

## If your pattern is predominantly shutdown

Your nervous system habitually "disconnects" you. The task is to gently "defrost" without triggering a jump into mobilization.

> ⚠️ Abrupt stimulation during shutdown can cause a rebound into deeper shutdown or a sudden spike into mobilization (panic). All practices here are gentle and gradual.

### Practice: Gentle activation through the feet

**What to do:**
Sit down and place your feet on the floor (barefoot if possible). Feel the contact. Slowly press your feet into the floor — about 20% of your maximum. Hold for 5 seconds. Release. Repeat 5-10 times.

**Why it works:**
Shutdown involves losing contact with the body and with the "ground." Foot pressure is a gentle proprioceptive signal that activates sensory pathways without triggering a stress response. It helps you return "into the body" gradually.

### Practice: Sound and vibration

**What to do:**
Produce a long "mmmm" or "voooo" — on the exhale, in a low tone. Feel the vibration in your chest and throat. Repeat 5-10 times.

**Why it works:**
Vibration from vocalization stimulates the vagus nerve, which passes near the vocal cords. Voluntarily producing sound moves you out of shutdown's passivity.

### Practice: Temperature contrast on hands

**What to do:**
Hold your hands under warm (not hot) water for 30 seconds. Switch to cool (not cold) for 15 seconds. Back to warm. Pay attention to the sensations.

**Why it works:**
Gentle temperature contrast is a sensory signal noticeable enough to "reach" a dampened nervous system, but not so sharp as to trigger a stress response.

---

## If your pattern is "the pendulum" (mobilization ↔ shutdown)

### Practice: Tracking switches

**What to do:**
When you notice a switch from one mode to another — mark the moment. What happened right before? What was the trigger? Was there even a second of something else between mobilization and shutdown?

**Why:**
The pendulum pattern runs automatically and fast. Slowing it down through observation gives the nervous system a chance to "linger" in an intermediate state — which often turns out to be closer to connection.

### Practice: "Safe enough"

**What to do:**
When you're in mobilization — instead of "calm down," say to yourself: *"Right now, I'm safe enough."* Not "everything's fine" — that might not be true. Specifically "safe enough."

**Why:**
The command "calm down" is often perceived by the nervous system as dismissing the threat. "Safe enough" is a more honest, and therefore more effective, signal.

## General recommendations

1. **Start with one practice.** Pick the one that creates the least resistance.
2. **Regularity beats intensity.** 2 minutes every day is better than 30 minutes once a week.
3. **Don't evaluate "progress" daily.** First stable shifts may take 2-4 weeks.
4. **If a practice causes discomfort — stop.** The goal is gentle expansion, not pushing through.
5. **This doesn't replace therapy.** If your pattern is linked to traumatic experience, working with a qualified therapist (Somatic Experiencing, sensorimotor psychotherapy) may be significantly more effective.
