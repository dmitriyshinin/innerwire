# Questionnaire: Autonomic Profile

## How to use

This isn't a test with right answers. It's a self-observation tool. It helps you pay attention to what's happening in your nervous system in different situations.

Answer based on the last 2-3 months. Don't pick the "correct" answer — pick the honest one.

## Part 1: Baseline mode

*"Where do I spend most of my time?"*

Read the three descriptions. Estimate what percentage of an ordinary day you spend in each state. The total should roughly equal 100%.

### State A
You're calm but engaged. You can focus without much effort. Socializing doesn't exhaust you. Your body is relaxed but not "floppy." If someone speaks to you, you can listen and respond naturally. You're in contact with the world around you.

**My percentage: _____%**

### State B
You're on edge. Maybe it shows as anxiety, irritability, impatience. Maybe as constant busyness, inability to stop. Your body is tense (shoulders, jaw, stomach). Hard to relax even when objectively everything is fine. Thoughts keep spinning, hard to fall asleep.

**My percentage: _____%**

### State C
Little to no energy. The world feels muffled, distant. You can function but as if on autopilot. No motivation. You scroll your phone, binge shows — not because you enjoy it, but because you can't stop. Emotions are dulled.

**My percentage: _____%**

> State A = "Connection" mode
> State B = "Mobilization" mode
> State C = "Shutdown" mode

## Part 2: Stress response

*"Where do I go when things get tough?"*

Imagine a typical stressful situation — a conflict, a deadline, bad news, an unexpected problem. What happens in the first few minutes? After an hour?

### First reaction (minutes)

- [ ] I rev up: heart races, urge to act, anger or anxiety → **Mobilization**
- [ ] I disconnect: go numb, thoughts scatter, want to hide → **Shutdown**
- [ ] I notice the stress but stay engaged, can think about solutions → **Connection**

### After an hour

- [ ] Still wired, can't calm down → **Stuck in mobilization**
- [ ] Switched to shutdown, scrolling, no energy → **Dropped into shutdown**
- [ ] Already settled, back to normal → **Good recovery**

### Typical sequence

- [ ] Mobilization → Shutdown (wired first, then crash)
- [ ] Shutdown immediately (bypassing mobilization)
- [ ] Mobilization without shutdown (wired for a long time, then gradually easing)
- [ ] Connection → brief mobilization → return to connection

## Part 3: Connection mode accessibility

*"How easy is it for me to reach a state of calm engagement?"*

Rate each statement from 1 (not me at all) to 5 (definitely me):

| # | Statement | 1-5 |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | I have moments when I'm calm and engaged in what's happening — without special effort | ___ |
| 2 | I can listen to another person and truly hear them, without thinking about my own stuff | ___ |
| 3 | I know the feeling of a relaxed body with a clear mind | ___ |
| 4 | After stress, I usually recover within hours, not days | ___ |
| 5 | I don't need special conditions (alcohol, perfect silence, total solitude) to relax | ___ |
| 6 | I can be among people and feel comfortable doing so, at least sometimes | ___ |
| 7 | I'm able to enjoy simple things — food, a walk, a conversation | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 35**

- **28-35:** Connection mode is well accessible
- **18-27:** Connection mode is accessible but unstable
- **7-17:** Connection mode is difficult to access — this is the main area to work on

## Part 4: Body markers

*"What is the body saying?"*

Mark what's typical for you in your normal state (not during acute stress):

### Mobilization markers
- [ ] Tension in shoulders and/or neck
- [ ] Clenched jaw (especially during sleep)
- [ ] Shallow, rapid breathing
- [ ] Hard to sit still, need to move
- [ ] Trouble falling asleep (thoughts won't stop)
- [ ] Fast, hurried speech
- [ ] Tension in the stomach

### Shutdown markers
- [ ] Feeling of heaviness in the body
- [ ] Often cold (especially hands and feet)
- [ ] Quiet, monotone voice
- [ ] "Brain fog"
- [ ] Hard to initiate action, even simple ones
- [ ] Shallow but slow breathing
- [ ] Feeling disconnected from the body

### Connection markers
- [ ] Even, calm, reasonably deep breathing
- [ ] Body relaxed without feeling "floppy"
- [ ] Lively facial expressions, natural gestures
- [ ] Voice with intonation, not monotone
- [ ] Sense of being "here and now"

## Interpretation

### Your approximate pattern

Gather results from all four parts and try to describe your pattern in one or two sentences:

- *"I spend most of my time in mobilization, go into shutdown under stress, connection mode is accessible but unstable"*
- *"I'm mostly in shutdown, stress disconnects me further, connection mode is hard to reach"*
- *"Connection mode is available, but I easily slip into mobilization and take a long time to get out"*

### What's next

Now that you have your approximate pattern → move to [practices](practices.md).

## On the accuracy of this questionnaire

This is a self-observation tool, not a clinical test. It has not been validated and is not a diagnostic instrument. Its purpose is to help you notice what usually goes unnoticed.

For more accurate autonomic profiling, objective methods exist: heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), skin conductance measurements. More in [sources](sources.md).
