# InnerWire — Science-Based Open Framework for Self-Awareness

*Inner — internal. Wire — wiring. Your inner wiring: the nervous system, perception, and response patterns that make you who you are.*

🇷🇺 [Читать на русском](../ru/README.md)

## What is this

InnerWire is a model of individual differences based on measurable parameters of the nervous system, perception, and behavior. Unlike popular typologies (MBTI, Socionics, Human Design), InnerWire doesn't offer pseudoscientific "types." Instead, it provides a profile across several axes, each backed by peer-reviewed research.

## Who it's for

- People who want to understand themselves but can't bring themselves to believe in astrology
- People who value an evidence base and want to see references
- People looking for practical tools, not just descriptions
- Professionals who need an integrative framework

## Principles

1. **Scientific foundation** — every claim is backed by references to peer-reviewed research
2. **Layers of complexity** — each layer is self-contained and useful on its own
3. **Spectrums, not types** — people vary along continuums, not discrete categories
4. **Dynamics** — your profile isn't a verdict; it changes with state, context, and practice
5. **Openness** — the model is open to criticism, contribution, and evolution

## Model structure

| Layer | Name | Core idea | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | [Autonomic Profile](model/layer-0-autonomic/) | Three modes of the nervous system | 🟡 draft |
| 1 | Interoceptive Profile | How well you sense your body | ⚪ planned |
| 2 | Sensory Profile | How you process sensory input | ⚪ planned |
| 3 | Attachment Pattern | How you build closeness with others | ⚪ planned |
| 4 | Allostatic Load | Current stress "wear and tear" | ⚪ planned |

**Each layer includes:**
- A description accessible without specialized education
- In-depth material for those who want to go deeper
- A questionnaire / method to determine your profile
- Practices tailored to your profile
- A list of scientific sources

## How to read

**If you're here for the first time** — start with [Layer 0: Autonomic Profile](model/layer-0-autonomic/). It's self-contained and can already give you useful information about yourself.

**If you're a professional** — check the [sources](model/layer-0-autonomic/sources.md) and [bibliography](research/bibliography.md).

**If you want to contribute** — read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
