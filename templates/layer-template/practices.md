## General recommendations

- **Start small** — 1-2 minutes is enough to begin
- **Consistency over intensity** — daily practice for 2 minutes beats weekly practice for 30
- **Give it time** — 2-4 weeks minimum to notice changes
- **Stop if it makes things worse** — not every practice works for everyone. If something consistently increases discomfort, stop and try a different one
- **This is not a replacement for therapy** — if you're dealing with significant difficulties, practices complement but don't replace professional help
